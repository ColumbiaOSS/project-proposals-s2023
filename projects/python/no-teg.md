# no-teg

## Description

'no-teg' (get-on backwards) is a library for running tournaments. In the beginning it will be simple i.e. setting up and advancing through different tournament styles. Eventually if things go smoothly the library will also compute data on the tournaments and players. Being open-source, I hope that people will add tournament styles and different analysis that are dependent on different games.
