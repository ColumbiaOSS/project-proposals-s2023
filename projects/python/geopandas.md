GeoPandas is a project to add support for geographic data to pandas objects. It currently implements GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame types which are subclasses of pandas.Series and pandas.DataFrame respectively. GeoPandas objects can act on shapely geometry objects and perform geometric operations.

## Issues

- [BUG: GeoDataFrame.iterfeatures with na='drop' crashes on non-scalar columns]
