## Description

'print-structure' is a library for printing out complex data structures such as tree and dp table.
There are various complex data structures that are commond in leetcode or codeforce. When we try to debug and inspect these data structures using debugger in IDEs, contents in those structures can't be intuitively displayed. Therefore I want to write a python package that can beautifully print out these structures and help users to inspect their contents.
