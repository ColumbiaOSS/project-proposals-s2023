## Description

`soccer-api-wrapper` is a library for getting information about soccer matches in the five big club competitions, with live score, fixtures, and stats of games available. As writing GET and POST requests multiple times to get data can be frustrating, the library will streamline the process of retrieving information about soccer by making the API calls under the hood as an API Wrapper.
