Fantasy football is a game that many Americans play every year. Many people want to analyze players/teams with advanced statistics, but the important statistics
are hard to distinguish for the casual player. There are many websites that detail these statistics, but many are missing information that could be found on others.
My proposal is to create a web application that connects to all of these websites and retrieves all of this information for easy viewing.
