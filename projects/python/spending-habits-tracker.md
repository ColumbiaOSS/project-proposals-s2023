## Description

Spending-Habits-Tracker (<https://github.com/uyozulku/spending-habits-tracker>) is a Python library to provide real-time data of a user's spending habits. Using third-party API services (e.g. Plaid) to connect to a user's bank account, the library will provide a user with a real-time, daily or month-over-month view of their spending habits, such as how much money they spent on each major payment category (as can be retrieved by merchant category codes). The library will also provide methods to create a visual representation of their spending habits.
