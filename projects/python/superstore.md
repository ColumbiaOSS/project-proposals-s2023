# Superstore

## Project Contributions

At the moment, my most likely idea is to expand the Superstore fake data creator. I would raise a feature request to make it more customizable, with more potential 'situations' of fake data: not just a store, but also an office building, a school or university, and so on.

The fake data creator could be used to fill in data visualizations, but also to test data cleaning or handling.
