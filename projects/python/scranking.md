## Description

Scranking is a library designed specifically for extracting data from [swimcloud](https://www.swimcloud.com/swimmer/549377/), a comprehensive website that showcases the times and rankings of high school and college swimmers.

The library will allow users to simpily type the URL and get all the neccessary information of that swimmer.
