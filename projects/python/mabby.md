## Description

`mabby` is a library for simulating [multi-armed bandits (MABs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit), a resource-allocation problem and framework in reinforcement learning. It allows users to quickly yet flexibly define and run bandit simulations, with the ability to:

- choose from a wide range of preset classic bandit algorithms to use
- configure environments with custom arm spaces and rewards distributions
- collect, store, and visualize simulation statistics
