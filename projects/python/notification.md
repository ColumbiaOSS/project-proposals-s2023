# Sending Notifications to Your Smartphone for Specific Keywords in Emails

The project involves creating a program that reads gmail and sends notifications to your smartphone using slack when a specific keyword appears. This idea came from the challenge of having to sort through many emails every day to find the important ones. Gmail already has a labeling function that classifies emails based on specific email addresses as filters. This project aims to create a function that sends notifications based on keywords using slack and smartphones. There is also potential to expand this project to find information in other ways besides just keywords.

## Description
For this project, I need to find a way to use Gmail on Python first.

- Create code to read email content
- Create a code to send a message when you receive an email with a specific keyword
