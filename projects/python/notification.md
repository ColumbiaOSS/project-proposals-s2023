## Description

The Email Keyword Notifier is a Python-based application designed to help users manage their email inboxes more efficiently by monitoring incoming Gmail messages for specific keywords and sending real-time notifications to their smartphones via Slack. The goal of this project is to enable users to quickly identify and prioritize important emails without manually sorting through their inboxes, ultimately enhancing productivity and organization.

To achieve this, the application leverages the Gmail API to access the user's Gmail account and read incoming messages. The application searches for the user-defined keywords in the email's subject and body. When a match is found, the application utilizes the Slack API to send a notification to the user's Slack workspace, alerting them of the important email.

Key features of the Email Keyword Notifier include:

1. Seamless integration with Gmail and Slack APIs for reliable monitoring and notifications.
2. User-defined keyword search to ensure only relevant emails trigger notifications.
3. Real-time notifications sent to users' smartphones via Slack for quick response to important messages.

In addition to building the core functionality, the project was developed with a strong focus on best practices in software development and project management. This includes setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, implementing automated testing, enhancing documentation, code refactoring, and dependency management to improve the overall maintainability of the project.
