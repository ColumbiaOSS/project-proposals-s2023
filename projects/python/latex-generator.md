# Latex Generator

A lot of homeworks are required to be done in Latex. Whenever this is the case, I usually write out the homework by hand and then spend a lot of time converting my work to Latex. The tool detexify does exist for this purpose, but it's quite simple and is only able to suggest symbols based off of drawings. I would like to build a tool that can take a picture of a more complex mathematical expression and generate the corresponding expression in latex.
