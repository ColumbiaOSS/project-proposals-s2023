- Background: Pandas is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool. I've used Pandas both for coursework and research, so it is a good project for my first open source contribution. 

## Issues
- [BUG: when inner/outer-joining dataframes with categorical MultiIndex, the output index dtype depends on row ordering](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/50906)
