Python

- Exchange Rate Converter

The project will involve finding the necessary libraries and writing a code that can crawl exchange rate information using different output codes.

Python (Automation)

- Web Page Automation Using Auto Mouse

The goal of this project is to create a program that can automatically retrieve weather information from a web page. The code will manipulate the mouse and keyboard to extract the weather information in real-time when the user requests it.

- Sending Google Emails

The project involves writing a code that can automatically send a large number of emails by sending an email to a Python code through Google Mail. The email addresses will be read from an Excel file.

- Sending Notifications to Your Smartphone for Specific Keywords in Emails

The project involves creating a program that reads gmail and sends notifications to your smartphone using slack when a specific keyword appears. This idea came from the challenge of having to sort through many emails every day to find the important ones. Gmail already has a labeling function that classifies emails based on specific email addresses as filters. This project aims to create a function that sends notifications based on keywords using slack and smartphones. There is also potential to expand this project to find information in other ways besides just keywords.

Python (Crawling)

- Collecting Real-time Search Terms

The project involves creating a program that can gather real-time search terms to identify trending topics. There is a high possibility of expanding this project by incorporating smartphones or converting it into a GUI program.

Python (AI)

- Creating a Speech Recognition Secretary

Inspired by the popularity of chatGPT, this project involves creating a voice recognition assistant that converts voice into text through voice recognition and performs actions based on the conditions of the text.

- Recognizing and Classifying People in Pictures

This project uses the torch library to classify only person pictures among various types of pictures and move them to a specific folder.
