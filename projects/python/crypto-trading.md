# CryptoRL

CryptoRL is a Python based project, fetching historical data of certain cryptocurrencies and using ML and RL to do cryptocurrency trading. Now it has concrete functions for fetching data and processing data, ML methods including linear regression, decision tree, and neural network to predict future prices. I'm still working on the RL parts.
