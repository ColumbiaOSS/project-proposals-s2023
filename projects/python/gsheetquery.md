# GSheetQuery

## Description

[gsheetquery](https://github.com/swimninja247/gsheetquery) is a python library that allows you to use google sheets as a document database.

For small projects, full Python frameworks can be overkill (Django), especially if you want code up and running quickly. Google Sheets can be leveraged as a database and made accessible by GSheetQuery.

This library will allow users to interact with google sheets as a document database similar to MongoDB.
