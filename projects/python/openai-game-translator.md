- Provided multiple transcription models for selection, text completion based OpenAI translation, various OpenAI language models, and target language selection, making the translation more natural and accurate to everyday spoken language.
- Even better translation based on openai's role-playing, context completion, and multimodal fusion of images, sounds, and subtitles.
