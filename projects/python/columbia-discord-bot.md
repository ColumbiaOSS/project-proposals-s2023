# Columbia University Discord Bot

[project link](https://github.com/mw3071/columbia-discord-bot)

## Description

This discord bot will help students in our discord server find other students in the same class or have experiences with that class so that they can seek homework help, recommendations, or reviews of that class.
Another feature would be to allow students to know what computers are avaliable at the Wallach Gaming Lounge and be able to reserve space or see when computers will be free.
