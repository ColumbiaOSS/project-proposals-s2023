## Description
- This repository is a collection of open-source implementation of a variety of algorithms implemented in C++ and licensed under MIT License. These algorithms span a variety of topics from computer science, mathematics and statistics, data science, machine learning, engineering, etc.. The implementations and the associated documentation are meant to provide a learning resource for educators and students. Hence, one may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using a different algorithm strategies and optimizations.

## Issues
- [2D sorted matrix search [enhancement]](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus/issues/2056)
- [Adding algorithm for Tower of Hanoi Problem](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus/issues/2263)
