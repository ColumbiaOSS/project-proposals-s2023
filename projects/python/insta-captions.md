## Description

`insta-captions` is a library that deals with the conversion of audio into "captions". The main feature that I envision for this project would be for audio to be converted into text of any (supported) language regardless of the language of the input audio. This involves two, albeit involved, steps:

- given an audio file, convert that audio into text of language it is in
- given text of one language, translate into another
