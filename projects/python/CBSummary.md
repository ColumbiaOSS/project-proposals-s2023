## Description

Researching information on trends for companies can be incredibly tedious, this library will automate part of the proccess making DCF building and IPO research easier. CB_IPO is a library that will fetch information on recent and historical IPOs by scraping the SEC EDGAR database for S-1 filings. These queries can also be modified to search for certain dates, and additional forms. This data can subsequently be placed in a pandas dataframe for the sake of easy viewing. A second proccess this autmoates is finding the specific 10-K filings for a company. By inputing a cik, a list of 10-k filing links will be returned.

The project will be written in python and use selenium to run a local webscraper.
