## Description

`forecast-weather` is a library that allows a user to easily obtain weather data (temperatures, pressure, humidity, precipitation, wind, cloud coverage, etc.) across various locations and dates. The library will make calls to a public weather API and will organize the returned data for ease of use. Some extra functionality in consideration include some form of visual plot/graph generation. The library will be written in Python.
