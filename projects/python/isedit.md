## Description

A python library that helps bridge a music notation library (such as Lilypond via Abjad(<https://abjad.github.io/index.html>) to an audio player (such as pydub). The goal is to resolve the following: "Abjad provides no audio output beyond LilyPondâ€™s built-in MIDI functionality" (<https://abjad.github.io/first_steps/audience.html>).

A successful implementation will be helpful both for individuals creating music-composition tools / applications, as well as individuals looking to play around with music composition and sound in a notebook, and will cut the time from starting a music project to hearing actual sound (an element which has been a personal annoyance).
