# Fantasy Baseball Lineup Helper

## Description

In this project I want to build a library that scrapes baseball reference. My aim in this project is to help fantasy baseball owners with with their daily lineup. My project will display stats for players on a fantasy team over the course of a period that can be defined by the user. This can help owners see which players are on a streak and favorable matchups.

Some aspects I hope to include are:

- hitting stats over last x amount of games
- Splits over the last x amount of games
- matchup against projected pitcher of the day
- compare players feature
