## Description

'disease-spread' is a tool that will give users the capacity to visualize the spread of a disease upon appropriate data input. I plan to implement capabilities for both geographical and temporal data.

- Geographical: Includes a map capability that will indicate the layout of the data input (Certain countries/states/counties will darken based on amt of cases present)
- Temporal: Will be able to scrub back and forth in time to see when different areas become infected
