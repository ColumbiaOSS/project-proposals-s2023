[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Algorithms-Python-blue)](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python)

The project includes all algorithms implemented in Python.

I intend to contribute some new algorithms that I have written while participating in algorithm contests and solve some existing issues for this project.

## Issues

- [Concatenate all algorithms with different implementations ](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/issues/8098)
- [Importance of caching algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/issues/8083)
