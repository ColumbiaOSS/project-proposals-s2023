# Open Library

## Project Description

The project I thought of contributing to was on Open Library. Open Library is a webpage that contains every book ever published. Users can view, borrow books and search for any information about a book. One of the issues I found was that when creating a link, for example a link in a social media post, the link display does not contain the author of the book. Instead, it contains the year of the edition of the book. The issue states that the author is more important than the year that edition was published and they want to make this change.
