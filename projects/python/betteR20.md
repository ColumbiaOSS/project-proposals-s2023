## Description

betteR20 is a userscript that runs on top of Roll20, a website that allows users to play games such as dungeons and dragons with friends. betteR20 allows users to import content and comes with a number of quality of life features, and in general makes Roll20 easier to use.

## Issues

Issues for betteR20 are contained on a private trello board, but some things I'd like to work on include:

- Make a generic handout importer for handouts without specific things to import
- Make the module importer use macros like the monster importer does
- Create multi sided tokens in the wild shape importer
