- Background: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

- Rationale: I've used numpy both for coursework and research, so it is a good project for my first open source contribution. To start off, I would like to work on one of numpy's good first issues (currently > 2k): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues Below is one that I've selected. 

## Issues

- [BUG: IndexError when using np.histogram with small values](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/23110)
