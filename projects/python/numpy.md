# Numpy

## Description

[Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) is a powerful, well-optimized, free open-source library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays (also called matrices or tensors). NumPy also comes equipped with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to work in conjunction with these arrays. These include basic linear algebra, random simulation, Fourier transforms, trigonometric operations, and statistical operations.
