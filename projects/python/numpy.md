- Background: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. I have worked with NumPy in the past for both coursework and research. 
## Issues

- [BUG: np.can_cast fails with string input](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22977)
