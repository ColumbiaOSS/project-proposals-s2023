Librosa is a library for audio and music processing in Python. Librosa has several tools for extracting features such as pitch and tempo from audio files. I hope to start out by improving some of the user-interface tools that would make some of the extracted features more human-friendly, and then expand into more complicated issues if I am able.

## Issues / Features

- [Feature: Built in frequency range data to give users an idea of the right frequency band to use for a particular sound] (<https://github.com/librosa/librosa/issues/1503>)
- [Feature: Tempo(gram) display with musical notation, i.e. giving users the ability to compare frequencies using more natural musical notation rather than just bpm numbers] (<https://github.com/librosa/librosa/issues/1426>)
