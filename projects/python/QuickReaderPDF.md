## Description

This package converts a pdf or a html file that the user wants to read to an new pdf file, which can be read faster! The idea is ["bionic reading"](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/what-is-bionic-reading-does-it-work_uk_628749a3e4b05cfc268a59ff), where we bold the first three letters of every word. We hope you enjoy reading your files faster!
