## Project Proposals

Right now the one I would most like to work on is a project that will change how you copy and paste text. There will be options to copy text without extraneous new lines; to copy text with *additional* newlines; to copy text with quotes around it; to copy text and automatically copy the URL as a citation; and, if I'm able to do all that (unlikely), to copy a table from PDF with correct formatting. 

This project might be a Google Docs extension (https://developers.google.com/apps-script).
