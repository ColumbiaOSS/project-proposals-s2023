**From the docs:**

pybaseball is a Python package for baseball data analysis. This package scrapes Baseball Reference, Baseball Savant, and FanGraphs so you don't have to. The package retrieves statcast data, pitching stats, batting stats, division standings/team records, awards data, and more. Data is available at the individual pitch level, as well as aggregated at the season level and over custom time periods

## Issues

- [top_prospects examples doesn't work](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball/issues/284)
- [Feature Request: Single game fangraphs stats](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball/issues/52)

Both of these are marked as good first issues.
