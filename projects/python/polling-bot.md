## Description

`polling-bot` is a Discord bot to conduct basic polling functions in a Discord server that I would like to build. Often times, reaching a consensus can be difficult without an organized method in place, and so the polling bot can be used to solve that need in a simple and efficient manner. Use cases would include deciding with friends on a place to eat, what game should be played, when to schedule a party, etc.

The bot supports starting a poll and adding options for choices by the users. The bot keeps track of responses made to the poll, and surfaces the winner of the poll when called upon. Users can vote once and the duration of the poll can be changed to expire when desired.
