PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:

- Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
- Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system


Usually, PyTorch is used either as:

- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.
- A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.
