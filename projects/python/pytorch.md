- Background: PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.

- Rationale: I use PyTorch for my research project. As it currently has 5K+ issues, I've selected it as a project that I will contribute to. 

## Issues
- [Support single-arg min/max](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/93539)
