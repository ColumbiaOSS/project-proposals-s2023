# SevenWondersDiscord

I want to extend my old project of [7 Wonders Board Game](https://github.com/MirrorCraze/7WondersEnv). 

Currently, the code itself is quite messy, as I was writing this to test my reinforcement learning algorithm in my project.

I would like to refactor my code so that the game will be able to run:

1. As a discord bot game with some rule-based bots or multiplayers.
or 
2. As a reinforcement learning library so that someone can download the library, customize the model/reward/action functions and train on them.

I'm still thinking between these two. I think that discord bot is probably easier as I already wrote all functionalities + bots for my training before.
