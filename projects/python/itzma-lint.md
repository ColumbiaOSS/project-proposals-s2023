<p align="center"> "Your Lint, Your Rules" </p>

Do you love using a linter but want even more personalized rules? Building off a traditional lint, ITZMA offers additional features such as:

*  Enforcing all functions that change the state of the programs to begin with verbs
*  Enforcing all functions that return values to be nouns
*  Enforcing array names to be plural nouns
*  ... and more!

Of course, ITZMA also contains traditional features, such as:

* Enforcing all booleans to begin with pre-allowed verbs
* Enforcing consistent case types
* ... and more!

ITZMA is a linter that lets you decide how your code will look and helps you enforce those rules!
