# validator.py

## Description
`validator.py` is a Python library with many builtin methods to validate and sanitize strings

The [validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js) library makes string validation and sanitization very simple.
validator.py will basically be a python port of this project.  I have not found a python project with the same level of simplicity as this.
