# USAU Scraper

## Description

The USAU scraper is a data collector that allows developers to easily aggregate and use team results, rosters, and schedule data from the [USAU website](https://play.usaultimate.org/events/tournament/?ViewAll=false&IsLeagueType=false&IsClinic=false&FilterByCategory=AE).
USAU (USA Ultimate) is the governing body of ultimate frisbee, and its website (which is notoriously hard to navigate) contains all of the information
about high school, college, and club ultimate frisbee teams. Right now, there is no easy way to access this data, and so I think that building a data
scraper that would allow other developers to easily use the data on the USAU site would open the door to more data analytics and other projects concerning
ultimate frisbee.
