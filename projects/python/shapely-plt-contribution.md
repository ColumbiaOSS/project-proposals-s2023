## Contribution ideas

I am still looking at different libraries, but it will likely be Shapely or MatPlotLib.

MatPlotLib is a plotting library for Python and NumPy specifically. There are lots of "good first" issues, but here are some interesting ones I found:\
**Large file size when using fill_between():** [link](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/22803)\
**plt.hist() fails with TensorFlow Numpy emulation:** [link](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/19574)\
**Add default kwargs values:** [link](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/24090)

Shapely is a BSD-licensed Python package for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects. It is harder to assess the difficulty of different issues because Shapely doesn't use the tags, but here's one that could be feasible:\
**translate returns NaN for some coordinates**: [link](https://github.com/shapely/shapely/issues/1524)

I will keep looking at other issues and projects and will likely consider more options in the future.
