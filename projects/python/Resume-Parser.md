## Description

This is a parser that extracts important information from a LinkedIn profile PDF. It converts the PDF to a list of strings, and then uses LinkedIn's headers to create a dictionary that maps said headers to string values that contain the most relevant parts of a candidate's profile.

## Description (Outdated as of HW4)

Mar.io is a bot for Discord -- a voice, video, and text chat app that is widely used by various gaming communities. When I started working on the bot in my freshman year, I envisioned the project as a proof of concept that could implement toy features for smaller groups (i.e. groups of 10-15 members). Some of these features included Wikipedia searches, limited YouTube streaming over voice chat, and some chat moderation features.

As part of this course, I'd like to start by refining some of these existing features. For example, the current version of the bot can only stream individual YouTube video; it cannot handle playlists that consist of several videos. Additionally, while Wikipedia is certainly a common resource to turn to, it may be more helpful to return the top results from Google, as Wikipedia may not be able to cover edge cases like memes.

Following these improvements, I also have some ideas for new features. In order to encourage activity in a given server, the bot could also keep a running tally of messages sent by each user. By scanning the chatlogs, the length(s) of messages sent by individual users, and the time between consecutive messages in a conversation, the bot could award members points for their activity. The aggregated scores could be displayed on a leaderboard that would be visible to all members in a given server, which could appeal to any competitive or particularly chatty users.
