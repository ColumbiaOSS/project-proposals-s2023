Astropy is a Python library for astronomical computations and data analysis. It provides tools and methods for working with astronomical data, such as 
support for handling and transforming coordinates, image processing, reading from and writing to various astronomical file formats, and performing 
various statistical calculations. Astropy is also designed to be a common interface for existing astronomical software packages.
