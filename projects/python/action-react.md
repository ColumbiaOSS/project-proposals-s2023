# action-react

`action-react` is a tool that listens to an account in a Telegram chat and makes corresponding http calls given the content of the message. This is inspired by [tuixue.online-visa](https://github.com/Trinkle23897/tuixue.online-visa), a tool that periodically checks and publishes US consulate visa appointment availabilities across the world.

A possible application of this tool is to use it to listen to a Telegram bot publishing messages about new visa appointments, and makes http calls to the consulate appointment service to grab the desired spot.
