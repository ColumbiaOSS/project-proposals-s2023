### Building My Own Repo

I want to build a repository to implement my computational biology research. My project involves recreating an evolutionary tree from sequencing of CRISPR-barcoded cells. This involves complex math: continous time Markov chains and Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. I want to add extensive testing and documentation to make this user friendly.

My repo can be found here: [Heracles](https://github.com/gil2rok/heracles).
