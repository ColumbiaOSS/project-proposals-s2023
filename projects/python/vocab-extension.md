## Project Proposal

I want to make a chrome extension that can parse through your screen (scrape the text) and determine which vocabulary words you may be unfamiliar with. This can be particularly useful when reading articles online. If you click the extension's button it would then show you the list of words and the definition underneath. You can also save words for future reference.
