NLP and its uses in speech interpretation.
AI and its uses in creating an intelligent responsive chatbot to interact with users.
Different packages and pre-trained tools are required to create a responsive intelligent chatbot similar to virtual assistants such as ALEXA or Siri.

The necessary libraries include:

JSON: It is possible to utilize it to work with JSON data.
String: Provides access to several potentially valuable constants.
Random: For various distributions, this module implements pseudo-random number generators.
WordNetLemmatizer: It can lemmatize.
Tensorflow: A multidimensional array of elements is represented by this symbol.
Sequential: Sequential groups a linear stack of layers into a tf.keras.Model.
