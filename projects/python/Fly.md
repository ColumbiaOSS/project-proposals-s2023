### FLY
[fly_tracker](https://github.com/Ritik3111/fly_tracker)
Build a library/browser extension - FLY:flight_departure:, that helps keep track of flight prices for you. 

A lot of websites that help you the best flight tickets exist - none of them help you track those flight prices. 
Although Google Flights does somwewhat help with this functionality , it does not let you add any kind of filters for the same.

Targets:dart: :
- [ ] Provide the user the option to monitor a particular route and notify them if the prices meet certain criteria. Eg. Let me know when the LGA-BOS route is cheaper than 100$
- [ ] Possibly try building a recommendation system that suggests the user the best time to book the ticket:seat:. Can possibly find and implement a research paper in the same area.
