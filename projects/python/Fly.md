Build a library/browser extension - FLY:flight_departure:, that helps keep track of flight prices for you.

A lot of websites that help you the best flight tickets exist - none of them help you track those flight prices.
Although Google Flights does somwewhat help with this functionality , it does not let you add any kind of filters for the same.

Targets:dart: :

- [ ] Provide the user the option to monitor a particular route and notify them if the prices meet certain criteria. Eg. Let me know when the LGA-BOS route is cheaper than 100$
