## Description

SportsCardTool is a python library for tracking and querying all exsisting sports card data. It has two main features:

- Querying entries based on any number of categorical factors quickly IE identify all of John Does autographed rookie cards

- Tracking their own collection via a database to provide metrics and potentially values

 Repository [Here](https://github.com/TravisGibbs/SportsCardTool)

Milestones:

1. Levrage webscraping to create basic database of cards via the topps website and ebay for potential images (will look for better source?)

2. Build tooling for querying and updating entries

3. Create api tooling allowing for tracking of PC (personal collection) for each user

4. Establish a pipeline for pricing using external sources that should already exsist
