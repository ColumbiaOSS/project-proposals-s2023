## Description

SportsCardTool is a python library for tracking and querying sportscard data.
It has two main features:

- Querying entries based on any number of categorical factors quickly IE identify all of John Does autographed rookie cards

- Tracking their own collection to provide metrics

Milestones:

1. Levrage webscraping to create basic database of cards via the topps website and ebay for potential images
2. Build tooling for querying and updating entries

3. Create api tooling allowing for tracking of personal collection for each user

4. Establish a pipeline for pricing using external sources that should already exsist
