Faker is a Python package that helps users generate fake data that looks realistic in nature. From bootstrapping databases to creating data for unit tests, Faker has generators to handle the different use cases needed to generate data of all different formats.

## Issues

- [Suggestion: generate valid data for barcode structures](https://github.com/joke2k/faker/issues/1774)
- [Suggestion: Generate Date Time values only for at certain times (e.g. Workdays, Weekends)](https://github.com/joke2k/faker/issues/1775)
