## Description

_Faker_ is a Python package that generates fake data for you. Whether
you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents,
fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from
a production service, Faker is for you.

Faker is heavily inspired by `PHP Faker`_, `Perl Faker`_, and by `Ruby Faker`\_.
