## Description

> _Faker_ is a Python package that generates fake data for you. Whether
> you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents,
> fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from
> a production service, Faker is for you.

> Faker is heavily inspired by [PHP Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker), [Perl Faker](https://metacpan.org/release/JASONK/Data-Faker-0.07), and by [Ruby Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker).
