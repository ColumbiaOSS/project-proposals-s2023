# streeteasy-scraper

## I've abandoned this project. Please see students/ag4219.md to see my new project

This is a webscraper idea for the website steeteasy.com, which is a real estate platform similar to zillow.com but specific to new york city.

I'd want to expose an api for developers to use that can get data not limited to

- rental units in a given area of the city
- rental units in a given price range
- rental units near a given MTA line
- rental units containing a given perk like a doorman, in-building laundry, elevator, etc (stretch goal)
- rental units put on market in the last given number of days
- rental units without brokers' fees
- and more...

And of course, these functions can be chained to filter down a list of rental units with some option to export the final data to a csv perhaps.

I think rental information is valuable, and possibly many other projects aiming at making the lives of renters in NYC easier could benefit
from a library such as this one.
