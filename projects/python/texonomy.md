`texonomy` is a Python tool that facilitates the generation of
entity-relationship diagrams $LaTeX$ using TikZ. It will provide a flexible
Python interface to easily produce and modify $LaTeX$ entity-relationship
diagrams. Users can create entities and add them to a diagram object by
specifying their relationships and relative positions. The diagram can be
exported as $LaTeX$ code, as a PDF, or as an image.
