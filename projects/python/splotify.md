## Description

`splotify` would be a library that combines the [Spotify Web API](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy) and a data visualization library (probably [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)) to allow users to easily view charts of some of their Spotify data, such as:

- favorite artists/songs/genres
- listening time/stats (i.e. danceability, energy, acousticness)
- pie charts of artists/songs/genres

Another idea I had was to make a tool that allowed you to create a specialized Spotify playlist based on features you normally wouldn't be able to easily filter by such as artist/genre/tempo/liveliness/length/etc. and particularly any combinations. Or, a tool that was able to identify duplicate songs/covers in a Spotify playlist, even if the names are in different languages.
