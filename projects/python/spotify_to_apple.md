For my project, I want to build a two way converter from Apple Music to Spotify and vice-versa. One of the challenges with migrating to a music streaming platfrom
is that users have to manually transfer their catalog of music built up over years. For some, this task is too difficult to do manually because of the sheer number
of playlists and songs, therefore this open source project will decrease the switching cost and give them increased freedom.

Technically, I want to build a fullo-stack application, with Python for the backend, Django for endpoints, and React.JS/JS for the front end. I want users to be able
to login on a simple UI interface using both of their accounts on spotify and apple music and easily transfer playlists by slecting which playlists they ewant to transfer.
