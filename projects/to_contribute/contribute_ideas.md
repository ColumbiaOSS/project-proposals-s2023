## Project Contributions

At the moment, I would most like to contribute to [Krita](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/krita). It's an animation program that I use and enjoy. Unfortunately, it's in C++ and Qt, neither of which I know, and I also don't know anything about graphics. It looks like there are Python scripting capabilities, so if that counts as a contribution I'd love to work with that.

Also, on reflection, if I'm allowed to raise my own issues, there's stuff I'd like to work on--e.g., my idea for the Superstore fake data creator would be good as a response to a feature request.

Aside from those:

Some random ones:
“scrapy” good first issue looks hard


Aside from those, I have included the libraries I know *of*, but I don't know anything about the internals of any of them, and for most, I barely know one or two functions. I'm having trouble finding beginner-friendly issues that aren't taken.

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- scipy
- seaborn
- re (https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.11/Lib/re/)
- vader
- SQLAlchemy
- pypi “requests” library (https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.11/Lib/re/) 
- BeautifulSoup
- IPython / Jupyter ??
    - Jupyter notebook (https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) 

Some other famous ones that I don't even know "one or two functions" from:
- “dash” apparently?
- NLTK (an NLP library)

Finally, I've included some lesser-known tools, which also seem difficult:

- maybe one of the open source writing tools?: https://github.com/open-source-writing-tools 
- Open DnD: https://github.com/opendnd 
- this one looks interesting and doable, but it was last edited like 3yrs ago and something’s wrong with the site—it was taken over by some random person’s portfolio, it looks like? https://github.com/nitronova/StudyGameDev.com 
- also hasn’t been updated in a while, also has something wrong with the site https://github.com/indentlabs/fiction-tools 
- this site looks good, lots of issues open but also lots of pull requests apparently unattended to https://github.com/indentlabs/notebook

...yeah. That's what I've got.
