# Customizable Unity AR Foundation Touch Based Controller Templates

For my project I want to make a library of customizable, touch-based, character controllers for Unity's AR Foundation on Android. When I work with Unity I have found myself copying and reusing code for controllers. Information about character controllers for AR Foundations is scattered, and the majority of it exists on YouTube in the form of tutorials which slows down development. I will gather existing tutorials, if permissible, while adding customzation features and premade UI elements.
