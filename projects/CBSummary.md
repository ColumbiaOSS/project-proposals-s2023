# CBSummary

## Description

Researching information on trends for companies can be incredibly tedious, so the goal of this library will be to automate part of the proccess. CBSummary is a library that will fetch information on recent and historical IPOs and utilize the Crunchbase API in order to generate different summary tables of the data available on Crunchbase. This will output information on founding, descriptions and other relevant information for certain queries. Besides summaries of these companies the library will also generate charts regarding trends such as those by industry for new companies going public.

The project will be written in python and use the CruncbaseBasic API, and polygon.io among others.
