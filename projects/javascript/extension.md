## Extension for Prime Video
- My goal is to create an extension on Google Chrome for Prime Video that will translate a word from one language to another when clicked on it. There's an extension that does this for Netflix, but Prime Video users could also benefit from that.

## Why will it be useful?
- To learn a new language, it's always good to watch content in the language you want to learn, though we expect to come across a lot of words we don't know. So instead of switching the language all the time, it's useful to just click on a word get the translation in the desired language.

## Which technologies
- The main programming language appears to be Javascript. I may need to use some other programming languages to help with it, but mainly it'll be Javascript.
