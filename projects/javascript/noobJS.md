## Description
`noobJS` is a library to collect useful snippets of code that are frequently used in simple and complex programs. The inspiration behind this comes from class lectures and the popular open-source project `30 seconds of code`. Of course, this would be a much smaller scale version of that project to assist in better learning both javascript and open source development.
