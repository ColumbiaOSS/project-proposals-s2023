# Content Analyzer - Google Chrome Extension

Extensions are software programs, built on web technologies (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that enable users to customize the Chrome browsing experience. I want to create a `Google Chrome extension` that provides analytics on the article or PDF document you are reading.

## Possible Features

- summarize content
- display key terms
- highlight key themes
- score overall sentiment
