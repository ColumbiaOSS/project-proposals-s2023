## Description

Review Master is a library to visualize business intelligence derived from sentiment analysis on product reviews. For example, let's imagine a pair of headphones, listed on an e-commerce website, that has thousands of customer reviews associated with it. The seller can read through all of them but it would be time-consuming. When sentiment analysis is performed on these reviews, the results would show what percentage of the customers think the product is cheap/expensive, durable/short-lived, or high-quality/low-quality and more. I will create this library that allows visualizing the business intelligence derived from these results with features such as a historical view of sentiment change.
