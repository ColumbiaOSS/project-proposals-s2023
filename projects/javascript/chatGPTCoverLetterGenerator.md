# Chat GPT Cover Letter

[link](https://github.com/jaesungpark42/GPTCovLet)

Plans to generate this idea involves webscraping a LinkedIn job post URL, specifically the job description features (location, company size, etc.)

I will try to plug this with other preset prompts into the ChatGPT API so it is specifically tailored to generate a plausible and compelling cover letter.

Complications include the different types of job posting, but I could divide into keywords to use when a sentence comes up, since they tend to be similar language-wise.
