## Description

`custoplayer` is a react.js package for helping developers quickly create customizable video players. The package will allow developers to add progress bars, volume bars, play buttons, and many other components to their video player.

These components will be able to be customized in their layout and color. For example, if a developer wanted to put his play button on the right side of the video and make it blue, that will be possible.
