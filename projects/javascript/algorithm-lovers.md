## Description
Algorithm is a topic that everyone who studies computer science cannot avoid. 
When I first learned algorithms, greedy, divide and conquer, and dynamic 
programming all made me miserable. However, I gradually became addicted to them. 
Especially when I apply the learned algorithms to my own projects, the echo of 
theory and practice makes my interest in algorithms soar. I am participating 
in competitive programming this semester. After being exposed to many novel 
problems in the contest, I wrote some novel algorithms. 

I plan to build a web platform that

1. Shares the algorithms I created to more people who love algorithms.
2. Creates a community where you can discuss algorithms and share opinions.
