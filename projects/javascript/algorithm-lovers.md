## Overview

Algorithm is a topic that everyone who studies computer science cannot avoid.
When I first learned algorithms, greedy, divide and conquer, and dynamic
programming all made me miserable. However, I gradually became addicted to them.
Especially when I apply the learned algorithms to my own projects, the echo of
theory and practice makes my interest in algorithms soar. I am participating
in competitive programming this semester. After being exposed to many novel
problems in the contest, I wrote some novel algorithms.

Therefore, I build a web platform that:

1. Shares the algorithms I created to more people who love algorithms.
2. Creates a community where you can discuss algorithms and share opinions.
