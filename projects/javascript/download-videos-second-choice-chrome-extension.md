# download-videos-second-choice-chrome-extension

## Description

As a second choice, I plan to create a Chrome Extension called 'download-videos' which allows users to save Youtube videos in 2x speed or 0.5 speed along with closed captions if they choose. 
The library will automatically save the tutorials, or the audio of any youtube video, into the "Downloads" folder for users. This way, they can download videos in bulk 
and have the option to watch videos quickly or slowly depending on their preference. 
As a student, I know that we often want to watch tutorials or hear lectures on various concepts but may be under a time constraint. This Chrome Extension
will have any easy-to-use interface to download videos in faster speed in bulk so that the user can easily watch them whenever it is convenient for them.

This 'download-videos' Chrome Extension has 3 main features:
- allow users to customize speed before downloading
- allow users to select closed captions before downloading
- capability download multiple videos from Youtube to "Downloads" folder in parallel
