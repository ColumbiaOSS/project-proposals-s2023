<p align="center"> "Safe social app for Columbia and Barnard students" </p>

[Mingly](https://github.com/tchitrakorn/Mingly) is a social app developed for Columbia and Barnard students to navigate socializing during the pandemic.

Mingly allows users to:

* Create an event card for other users to join
* Request to join an event created by other users
* Have a personal profile where all created and joined events are displayed
* ... and more!

I would like to contribute to Mingly by:

* Making Mingly more secured with a proper login system or hashed passwords ([related issue](https://github.com/tchitrakorn/Mingly/issues/8))
* Correctly updating events page after a new event has been added (no issue available but the bug is most likely related to React hooks)
