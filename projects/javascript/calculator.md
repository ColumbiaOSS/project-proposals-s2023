# Calculator

[calculator](https://github.com/danthareja/contribute-to-open-source/issues/1)

The project has a scenario where I am at a calculator company and there are some unnecessary parts in our code that need to be fixed.

I believe this project is ideal for my first contribution. Although I am unfamiliar with both Git and GitHub, as well as the concept of "contribution," the project does not seem overly burdensome, so I can feel a sense of accomplishment. Additionally, I think it will allow me to gain a better understanding of the project as a whole.

## Issues

Currently, the given code is not able to derive the desired value when the test value is inserted. My goal is to find bugs and contribute to the proper testing.
