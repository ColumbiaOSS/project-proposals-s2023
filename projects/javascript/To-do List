Appropriate Level of Difficulty: I think creating a to-do list is an appropriate project in terms of its level of difficulty. I am not a fast learner, but I believe I can complete this project in a semester.

Extensibility: The to-do list project has the potential to be extended with various functionalities. 
For example, the core functionality is to add and delete tasks. But, it can be further expanded to include an alarm function that alerts the user when the deadline is approaching. 
Additionally, a filter function can be added to allow users to find specific information easily.
