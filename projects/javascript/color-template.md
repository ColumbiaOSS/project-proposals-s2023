# color-themer

Currently, a huge pain point for me when I develop on React or on the frontend is needing to find the right colors and their RGB codes. It takes up a lot of time to test out the different colors and tweak the RGB values. Thus, to combat this issue, I want to create a Javascript library that can generate colors for components based on a user inputted image. The library will have one public method that returns a theme based on the highest frequency colors in the image.
