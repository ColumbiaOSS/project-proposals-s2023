# Mongo-Wrapper Project Description

<strong> Project: MongoDB Wrapper Library for Node </strong>

<strong>Objective:</strong>
To simplify the process of working with MongoDB in a Node.js application by providing easy-to-use and intuitive interfaces for common read and write operations.

<strong>Description:</strong> The MongoDB Wrapper Library will be a Node.js library with the purpose of providing an abstraction layer over MongoDB, making it easier for developers to interact with the database without having to write complex MongoDB queries while building their node applications. The library will provide a set of well-defined, easy-to-use interfaces for performing common MongoDB operations, such as inserting, updating, retrieving, and deleting data. This will allow developers to focus on their application logic, without having to spend time and effort on learning the intricacies of MongoDB.

<strong>Features:</strong>

1. Simple and intuitive interfaces for read and write operations
2. Abstraction layer over MongoDB, allowing developers to work with the database without having to write complex queries
3. Supports the most common MongoDB operations, such as inserting, updating, retrieving, and deleting data
4. Well-documented code and API, making it easy to get started and integrate into existing applications

<strong>Technology Stack:</strong>

| Name  | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| NodeJS    | runtime platform to build the library  |
| TypeScript    | programming language to be used to build the library  |
| MongoDB    | to initialize the wrapper with the database  |
| NPM   | for publishing the library to the NPM registry  |


<strong>Why this library?:</strong>

1. Improves developer productivity by providing a more intuitive way to interact with MongoDB
2. Increases the adoption of MongoDB by making it easier for developers to get started and integrate into their applications
3. Saves time and effort by eliminating the need to write complex MongoDB queries
4. Encourages new entry-level developers to work with MongoDB


<strong>Deliverables and Expected release time: </strong>

The library will be released as a package that can be easily installed from the NPM registry, expected to by available in 4/2020. The library will be open-source and community contributions are strongly encouraged.
