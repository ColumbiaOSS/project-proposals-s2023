# MongoDB

## Description

For the Open Source Contribution aspect, I plan to contribute to Md Monirul Islam's (im2594) MongoDB project. He plans to write a MongoDB wrapper library
to expand developer capabilities of using Mongo in a node app without already knowing how to write mongo-specific queries.
Monirul will provide interfaces so that the user can easily interact with common mongo read/write operations.

## Issues

Although I would need to see the final code to identify potential bugs/fixes or areas of improvement, my main concern will most likely be the security aspect (such as ensuring DB credentials are protected/not exposed). Another possible contribution for the project is that I may choose to add other mongo operations that can be added to the library to simply it further for developers.
