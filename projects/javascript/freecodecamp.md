"freeCodeCamp is a community of millions of people around the world who are learning to code together. You can learn to code with free online courses, programming projects, and interview preparation for developer jobs. We're a 501(c)(3) public charity."

It is a website with which I have learned and am still learning web development. It makes sense that a next step for me would be to contribute to the project itself.

## Issues

- [BUG: A lesson in Coding Interview Questions allows possibly incorrect code to pass]
