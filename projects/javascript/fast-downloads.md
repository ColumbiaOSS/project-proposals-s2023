## Description

I plan to create a Chrome Extension called 'fast-downloads' which allows users to save Youtube videos in 2x speed or 0.5 speed along with closed captions if they choose. The library will automatically save the audio of any youtube video with the chosen speed and caption option, into the "Downloads" folder for users. 

How it works: Users will enter the link(s) of the Youtube tutorial(s), lecture(s), etc into a form along with their preference of speed and caption option that they would like to apply to all videos within that same submission. Users can enter up to 5 YouTube links at a time on the form. The Chrome extension will then download the video into the user's "Downloads" folder (naming the file the same as the title of the Youtube video) for easy, convenient, on-the-go access. 

Why it's important: Because the extension can set up speed and caption preferences for multiple videos at a time, users can download videos in bulk and have the option to watch videos with their prefered options, even if they lose access to internet later on. Saving the videos to the Downloads folder can also help users remember to watch those videos in the first place. This can especially benefit students who found great Youtube tutorials or lectures that they wish to watch at a later time. Although the "Watch Later" option exists for users of Youtube, not everyone has a YouTube account or wants to sign into their account at the time in which they found the tutorial/lecture. 
The speed preference is another useful feature. As a student, I know that we often want to watch tutorials or hear lectures on various concepts but may be under a time constraint. And if we change speed options for a video on YouTube, we either have to pause the video to do this or miss some time from the video, which can be inconvienent to do over and over especially if someone is watching a series of videos on a particular technology, for instance. This Chrome Extension will have any easy-to-use interface to download videos in faster speed in bulk so that the user can easily watch them whenever it is convenient for them.

This 'fast-downloads' Chrome Extension has 2 main features:
- allow users to customize speed and caption options before downloading
- can download multiple videos from Youtube to "Downloads" folder in parallel
