# fast-downloads

## Description

I plan to create a Chrome Extension called 'fast-downloads' which allows users to save Youtube videos in 2x speed or 0.5 speed. The library will automatically save the audio of any youtube video with the chosen speed option, into the "Downloads" folder for users. 

How it works: Users will enter the link(s) of the Youtube tutorial(s), lecture(s), etc into a form along with their preference of speed option that they would like to apply to all videos within that same submission. Users can enter up to 5 YouTube links at a time on the form. The Chrome extension will then download the video into the user's "Downloads" folder (naming the file the same as the title of the Youtube video) for easy, convenient, on-the-go access. 

Why it's important: Users can download YouTube videos in bulk with the speed option of their choice (default is 1x) and have the opportunity to watch videos with their prefered options, even if they lose access to internet later on. This is a great feature especially for students living in rural areas or places that are more susceptible to sudden internet outage. Moreover, saving the videos to the Downloads folder can also help users remember to watch those videos in the first place. This can especially benefit students who found great Youtube tutorials or lectures that they wish to watch at a later time. Although the "Watch Later" option exists for users of Youtube, not everyone has a YouTube account or wants to sign into their account at the time in which they found the tutorial/lecture. Therefore, this extension would be very helpful for such users. 
The speed preference is another useful feature. As a student, I know that we often want to watch tutorials or hear lectures on various concepts but may be under a time constraint. And if we change speed options for a video on YouTube, we either have to pause the video to do this or miss some time from the video, which can be inconvienent to do over and over especially if someone is watching a series of videos on a particular technology, for instance. This Chrome Extension will have any easy-to-use interface to download videos in faster speed in bulk so that the user can easily watch them whenever it is convenient for them.

This 'fast-downloads' Chrome Extension has 2 main features:
- Customization of Speed: allow users to customize speed of YouTube videos before downloading
- Efficiency: can download multiple videos from Youtube to "Downloads" folder in parallel
