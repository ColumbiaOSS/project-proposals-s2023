## Description

Inspired by GitHub's [repo_visualization](https://githubnext.com/projects/repo-visualization/) tool, which allows users to visualize codebases,
I'd like to create a web application that
  
1. allows developers to visually plan out a codebase workflow using a diagram, and
2. produces a subsequent skeleton directory
