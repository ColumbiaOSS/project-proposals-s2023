# QueueR

## Disclaimer

The idea for this project is meant to be a user provides an auto-generated QR code for others to scan
and they'll be able to queue songs on the hosts' music application, but I've decided to hone in on Spotify using
the API and make the host get suggestive pings about what users request.

A sort of prelimary version/tool of what I hope the final project to be that'll surely get worked on beyond this class.

## Description

The host will share a link to friends or whomever, and users with a link can get on the site to see the music that has
been "queued" or requested to be played by the host.

The two main functionalities would be a search bar to find a particular song, and a list of the requested or "queued" songs,
with eventual hopes for optional anonymity for song suggestions.

At this point, the application uses the Spotify API to search and add songs to the Queue, and anyone can host their own room, but there are several OAuth features missing as well as solidifying the hosts' room "ownership."
