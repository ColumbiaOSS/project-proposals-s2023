# MongoDB

## Description
For the Open Source Contribution aspect, I plan to contribute to Md Monirul Islam's (im2594) MongoDB project. He plans to write a MongoDB wrapper library 
to expand developer capabilities of using Mongo in a node app without already knowing how to write mongo-specific queries.
Monirul will provide interfaces so that the user can easily interact with common mongo read/write operations. Although I would need to see the final code
to identify potential bugs/fixes or areas of improvement, one thing I may look out for is the security aspect (such as ensuring DB credentials are protected, 
identifying other mongo operations that can be added to the library to simply it further, etc).
