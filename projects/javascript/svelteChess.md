# svelteChess 

## Description

There isn't a good chess PGN reader for svelte apps like there is for react. There is a decent chess library but there's no simple plug ang play component. A chess pgn reader is basically a web app component that takes notion and lets you watch the game in real-time.

Basically, I have to make a chess set representation in svelte and an algorithm that takes in PGN notation and converts it into moves on the chess set representation.
