PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment. It provides two primary features:

- Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
- Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

## Issues

- [Support single-arg min/max](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/93539)
