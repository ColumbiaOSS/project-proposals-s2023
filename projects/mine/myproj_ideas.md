## Project Proposals

Right now the one I would most like to work on is a project that will change how you copy and paste text. There will be options to copy text without extraneous new lines; to copy text with *additional* newlines; to copy text with quotes around it; to copy text and automatically copy the URL as a citation; and, if I'm able to do all that (unlikely), to copy a table from PDF with correct formatting. This project might be a Google Docs extension.

If not, my other ideas are as follows: 

- google docs extension (https://developers.google.com/apps-script). Some ideas for these are (1) setting my keybindings automatically, e.g. my accent keybindings (2) using vim keybindings (looks like this already exists) (3) using LaTeX (also looks like it already exists) (4) resizing images that you copy-paste from your phone?? (5)maybe implement some of the open-source writing tools I found directly into google docs?

- expansion of Superstore fake data creator, but more customizable + with more 'situations' of fake data. could also be extended in a fiction-writing or RPG-playing direction: "create the staff of a building" and it just makes a bunch of characters and characteristics.

- if I were better at math / got help, I could implement the SEJI transform (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362791216_Solving_ordinary_differential_equations_using_a_new_general_complex_integral_transform)  for “Solving Population Growth and Decay Problems Using Complex SEE Transform” (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358047757_Solving_Population_Growth_and_Decay_Problems_Using_Complex_SEE_Transform)

- scrape wiktionary to make a dictionary that translates into multiple languages at once https://github.com/open-source-ideas/ideas/issues/180 

- dinosaur taxonomy library
    - https://github.com/junosuarez/dinosaurs is a list of dino names, but there’s no data on them
    - ‘dino’ classes, ‘clade’ classes, properties of dinos or clades, methods to compare when they lived, methods to compare their phylogenetic distance, method to pick a random dino, method to pick a random dino based on its clade
    - this is more of a database tbh

Old ideas that I'm keeping just for the heck of it:
- “what country was in a location at a given year”
- drawing prompt generator
- get citation from URL using scraper
- job search tool
    - create objects including job titles, company name, company size, summary, link, etc
    - prob exists already
    - why would python/js be better than excel?
- random generator
    - generates random numbers, names (of different types; see fantasynamegenerators.com), objects, words starting with a particular letter, etc
- character sorter
    - enter characters + relationships? this would be a database not a library
- class finder
    - check if there’s a waitlist, look up class info, time conflicts, what reqs are satisfied.
    - either overly abstract (just a framework) or overly granular (just Columbia)
