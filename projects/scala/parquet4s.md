# [parquet4s](https://github.com/mjakubowski84/parquet4s)

Parquet4s is a simple I/O for Parquet. It allows you to easily read and write Parquet files in Scala.
Use just a Scala case class to define the schema of your data. No need to use Avro, Protobuf, Thrift or other data serialisation systems. You can use generic records if you don't want to use the case class, too.
