## Description

`polling-bot` is a Discord bot to conduct basic polling functions in a Discord server that I would like to build. Often times, reaching a consensus
can be difficult without an organized method in place, and so the polling bot can be used to solve that need in a simple and efficient manner.
Use cases would include deciding with friends on a place to eat, what game should be played, when to schedule a party, etc.

The bot will support starting a poll and adding options for choices by the users. The bot will then keep track of responses made to the poll,
allow users to change their response, and surface the winner of the poll when called upon.

I would like to start with this basic functionality first, and then possibly add in more options such as 1) a timer function so the poll will remain
open for X hours or X days, 2) a nicer interface when the bot displays results in the server, and 3) possibly add in the ability to interface with
calender apis to schedule an event if desired.
