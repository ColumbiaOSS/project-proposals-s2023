# cabret

`cabret` is a Python tool that facilitates the generation of automata in
$LaTeX$ using TikZ. It will provide a flexible Python interface to easily
produce and modify $LaTeX$ automata. Users can initialize an automaton object
with a set of states, and can specify the transitions between them. The
automaton can be exported as $LaTeX$ code, as a PDF, or as an image.
