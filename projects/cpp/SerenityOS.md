# SerenityOS

## What is this

[SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) is an operating systems developed in C++. I especially like the 90's aesthetics because I've never had the chance to experience it.

## Possible contribution

I'd like to get to know the codebase a little better before I jump into contributing since I think this would be a fairly involved process.

Luckily the project has labels that indicates which issues are good for beginners. I'd like to tackle this [issue](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/issues/17153) first.
