AudioMoth is a low-power & low-cost portable acoustic logger written in C/C++/ARMv7 Assembly. I previously contributed to this project (my changes have not been published yet) last spring 2022 when I was studying abroad at the University of Oxford, working with Professor Alex Rogers who is one of the primary contributors / original creators. 


## Planned Contributions
After discussion with Professor Alex Rogers, I plan on finishing development + testing + integration of the modular Edge Impulse-based TinyML keyword spotting system on AudioMoth (recording audio samples based on keyword spotting). This will be eventually deployed as part of a National Geographic study on rare birds in Australia.
