PyScript is a meta project that aims to combine multiple open technologies into a framework that allows users to create sophisticated browser applications with Python. It integrates seamlessly with the way the DOM works in the browser and allows users to add Python logic in a way that feels natural both to web and Python developers.


## Issues

[BUG: Not All Browser Events are Represented in py-on* Events](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/issues/801)
