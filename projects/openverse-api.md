# Openverse API

### Description

This repository is primarily concerned with back end infrastructure like datastores, servers, and APIs. The pipeline that feeds data into this system can be found in the Openverse Catalog repository. A front end web application that interfaces with the API can be found at the Openverse frontend repository. This is a sub-project under Wordpress.
