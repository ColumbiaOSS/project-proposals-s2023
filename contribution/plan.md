Project Contributions

[First Contribution](https://github.com/danthareja/contribute-to-open-source/issues/1)

The project has a scenario where I am at a calculator company and there are some unnecessary parts in our code that need to be fixed

I believe this project is ideal for my first contribution. Although I am unfamiliar with both Git and GitHub, as well as the concept of "contribution," 
the project does not seem overly burdensome, so I can feel a sense of accomplishment. Additionally, I think it will allow me to gain a better 
understanding of the project as a whole.

When I looked at other projects labeled "For Beginners," I found the most challenging aspect to be the abundance of files in the folder. I often felt 
overwhelmed and unsure of where to start with the README.md file.

Therefore, for this project, I will make it a priority to thoroughly read the README file and understand the flow of how to contribute to the project.
