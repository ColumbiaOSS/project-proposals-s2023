## Project Proposal
A webscraper for streeteasy.com, that I will then add a simple to use
api on top of for developers to use in there apps.

## Project Contributions

- Matplotlib -> they have many issues tagged "Good First Issues"
- pwndbg -> Also many good first issues.
- scrapy -> many good first issues.

I've used these 3 projects before and would be interested in contributing to them in any way i can.
