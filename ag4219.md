## Project Proposal
A webscraper for streeteasy.com, on top of which I will add a simple to use
api for developers to use in their apps.

[more info here](./projects/python/streeteasy-scraper.md)

## Project Contributions

- Matplotlib -> they have many issues tagged "Good First Issues"
- pwndbg -> Also many good first issues.
- scrapy -> many good first issues.
- chess.js -> many issues that look approachable

I've used these 3 projects before and would be interested in contributing to them in any way i can.
