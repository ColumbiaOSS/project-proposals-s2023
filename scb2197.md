## Project Contributions
python pandas -- many good first issues to contribute to.

python plotly -- I am very familiar with this library and believe there are many ways I can contribute

[python dash](https://github.com/scb-school/project-proposals-s2023/blob/main/plotly-dash.md) -- similar to plotly, I am familiar with the library and believe I can contribute a lot
