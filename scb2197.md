## Project Proposal
[disease-spread](./projects/python/disease-spread.md)

## Project Contributions
python pandas -- many good first issues to contribute to.

python plotly -- I am very familiar with this library and believe there are many ways I can contribute

[plotly dash](./projects/python/plotly-dash.md) -- similar to plotly, I am familiar with the library and believe I can contribute a lot
