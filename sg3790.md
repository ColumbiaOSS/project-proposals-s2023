## Project Proposal
Create a python library that helps bridge a music notation library (such as Lilypond) to an audio player (such as pydub), so as to allow quick and easy integration/translation for individuals creating music composition programs. 

## Project Contributions
Work on fixing bugs in sound/ music related libraries. There are a number of issues in librosa that could be interesting to attempt solving.
