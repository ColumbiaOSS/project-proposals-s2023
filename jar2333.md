## Project Proposal
A library providing algorithms for calculating and modifying [st-orientations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_orientation) of graphs. 

I previously implemented an algorithm from [a paper by Papamanthou & Tollis](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-70904-6_22 ) in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jar2333/3stGraphGen/blob/main/3_Connected_st_Orientations.ipynb). With my recent experience designing APIs and writing libraries, I want to return to this project and offer an easy to use API for users, which allows customizing the algorithm as much as possible while encapsulating it. Additionally, implementing some more st-orientation algorithms is a secondary goal, though I would have to see which ones. I have an idea for an st-ofrientation optimizer, based on local search algorithms and Theorem 2 from [Fraysseix](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X9400085R).

It would be done in Python with [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) as a dependency.

## Project Contributions
I am planning to contribute to the [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) Python graph library, since it is a big project with many outstanding issues and I have used it before. 

Alternatively, I want to work on [a project called shadergraph](https://github.com/unconed/shadergraph) in some way. Written in JS, it provides a way of creating GLSL shaders programmatically by linking together differennt shaders arranged in a graph. This follows my recent interest in standalone tools for facilitating shader development. I recently contributed to [shadergarden](https://github.com/tonarino/shadergarden), adding functionality to support its use through piping configuration files via stdin, with my pull request pending review. For shadergraph, I would be interested in working on its outstanding issues, sure, but they are not numerous. My contributions would mainly be new features, although I have yet to determine which.
