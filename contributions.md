I wish to add onto the sec-api library (https://pypi.org/project/sec-api/) in python, by adding regulatory rules that would affect disclosure requirements from changing positions not just in stocks in America but also in Canada, Kenya, and South Africa, based on the disclosure rules for companies based in those jurisdictions, bringing in the functionality from this OSS: https://dev.to/ken_mwaura1/daily-share-price-notifications-using-python-sql-and-africas-talking-part-one-17p
