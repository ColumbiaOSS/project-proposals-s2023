## Project Proposal
I plan to work on a library that allows a user to easily obtain weather data (temperatures, pressure, humidity, precipitation, wind, cloud coverage, etc.) across various locations and dates. The library will make calls to a public weather API and will organize the returned data for ease of use. Some extra functionality I am considering include some form of visual plot/graph generation. The library will be written in JavaScript or Python.

## Project Contributions
Some projects that have many open issues and seem interesting to contribute towards include:
JavaScript: React.js, Node.js, Flow
Python: openai/point-e, numpy
