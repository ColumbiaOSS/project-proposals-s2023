## Project Proposal
-Using linkedin (maybe handshake and others too) job post descriptions to write a cover letter that sounds human using ChatGPT. 
-Job Application Autofiller: There are many, but each lack flexibility on different variety of job application versions, also the only open source one is really small and lacking https://github.com/lovincyrus/job-autofiller  
-Saving multiple pages of websites to a pdf. 

## Project Contributions
-Could be the job autofiller, but it is really small, I don't know if it would be an average experience of contributing to open source that this project intends to encourage.

Really open to suggestions for contributions. I donâ€™t have many tools/libraries that I use regularly that I have a problem with.
