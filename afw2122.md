## Project proposals
In full transparency, I was struggling to come up with project proposal ideas for this assignment, mostly because I’m unfamiliar with the open source community and I’m not sure what is needed versus what already exists. After some research, I know I want to build something in Python, and I came up with a couple of general ideas:

1. A tool that scrapes Twitter likes/replies to see when the last time a user has been active. It seems random, but I think it’d be useful for people who are into a celebrity/public figure and want to be notified when they are active (this is different from tweet notifications, as it’d be tracking likes/replies). 
2. I am really passionate about CS education, so I’d love to build some sort of tool that is approachable for beginners learning to code and/or is educational. Brainstorming some ideas related to this:
- Some sort of Python library that creates a scaffolding for a beginner project with educational explanations 
- An educational tool for learning how to code and/or learning a specific computer science skill
  - Maybe an interactive tool for learning Python with some sort of storyline so it’s fun and interactive (down the line contributors could add more stories/mini lessons). I’d want to address the problem in CS education where people don’t know ***where to start***; there are plenty of resources that exist, but complete beginners need more support

I’d love to hear feedback on these about whether or not I’m going in the right direction. I’m pretty flexible about what I’m making and just want to create something cool and useful.

## Project contributions
I am thinking about contributing to [Exercism](https://github.com/exercism/exercism), which is an open source platform for learning how to code. I love its mission and that it was founded by a woman. The only problem is that there don’t seem to be any [open issues](https://exercism.org/contributing/tasks) in Python, which is the language I was hoping to use in my contributions.

I am also thinking about contributing to [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook), as it’s a platform I’ve relied heavily on throughout my coursework at Columbia. I was poking around the repo and it seems like there are a lot of “good first issues,” so as a beginner to open source, this seems approachable and interesting!
