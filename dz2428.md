# Dmitrii Zakharov Project/Contribution Proposal

Project: I have an idea for an algorithm that could split a geometrical shape into regions based on shortest paths between points, using visibility graphs and k-medoids grouping. It could be useful in geospacial analysis - for example, dividing a map into regions that organically follow geographical features that block access (lakes, mountains, canyons, etc.). For this, I could write a Python module that could be used along with popular polygon libraries (like Shapely and SymPy).

Contribution: I've had to deal with Shapely quite a lot and I am familiar with certain unintuitive aspects of the library which I could potentially rework to make more user-friendly.
