## Project Proposal
I want to build a scraper for https://play.usaultimate.org/, which is the ultimate frisbee website tracking all teams/tournaments/game results, and 
build an API that allows users to query by team, tournament, division, and season to see game results, rosters, and images. Because ultimate frisbee 
is such a new sport, there are not any APIs to provide this data, but I think that it could be really useful to people wanting to build applications 
about ultimate in the future.

## Project Contributions
I want to contribute to [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball), which is an open source library to allowing developers to easily pull and use
baseball statistics in their projects.
