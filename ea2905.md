## Project Proposal
During much of 2022 I was working on a personal project to help people create customizable video players. The goal was to create a npm React.js library that exposes a React.js component. This component allows users to make changes (ex: change colors, change icons, change layouts) to the video player to make it customizable.

I want to kind of do a rewrite of this project as there were many bad design decisions that I made when first coding it up. For example, I want to use Typescript (for better intellisense and devX in general) and use a third party state management library instead of React Context.

## Project Contributions
I was looking at a popular React.js state management library named Jotai. There are some open projects that I think would be able to make good contributions to. I listed them below:

1. https://github.com/jotai-labs/jotai-devtools
2. https://github.com/jotai-labs/jotai-tutorial/tree/main
