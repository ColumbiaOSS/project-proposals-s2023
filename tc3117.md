## Project Proposal
- Idea 1: I would like to create a library/plugin that enforces consistent naming for variables and functions based on the user's preferences. Aside from case types (e.g., camel, snake), the user can also add more refined and personalized rules such as enforcing all booleans to begin with pre-allowed verbs, enforcing all functions that change the state of the programs to begin with verbs, enforcing all functions that return values to be nouns, enforcing array names to be plural nouns, etc. The extent to which rules can be personalized will later be determined.
- Idea 2: I would like to create a Python script that automates Broadway lottery signup process for me.
