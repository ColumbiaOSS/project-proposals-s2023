## Project Proposal
I'm thinking of creating a react native library integrating web3 authentication like metamask and connecting front end code to smart contracts.

## Project Contributions
I am currently developing the MVP for a startup using react native and think it would be exciting to contribute to the open source library. I wanna become more familiar with the react native library as well as learn more about open source in general.
