## Project Proposal
I am interested in building some type of web scraper for scores of sports games and comparing that data to what the sportsbetting odds and outcomes were.

## Project Contributions
Numpy and Matplotlib have a lot of Good First Issues tagged and I am also interested in Jupyter Notebook.
