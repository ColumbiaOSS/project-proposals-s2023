## Project Proposal

As of now, I would like to contribute on one of the four open source projects below:

1. Jupyter notebook
2. Jarvis
3. Pandas
4. Sympy

Since I do not have an extensive background in github/open source projects, I might need to change the topic I would like to work on for this semester - but I am willing to work on one of these projects for now!

## Project Contributions

- Skills/Libraries I have used

1. Pandas
2. Jupyter Notebook

- The way I would like to contribute

1. Fixing errors
2. Adding clarifications/documentations for beginners
3. Adding some new features
