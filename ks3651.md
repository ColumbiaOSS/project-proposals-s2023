## Project Proposal

I brainstormed some ideas and want to choose one of them, but I'm not sure if I've picked the right project. I'd like to discuss this problem with the professor after the next class or during office hours.

[Python](https://github.com/kw9212/project-proposals-s2023/blob/HW1-adding-proposal-for-ideas%2C-adding-first-contribution-project/projects/python/project_ideas.md)

Since I do not have an extensive background in github/open source projects, I might need to change the topic I would like to work on for this semester - but I am willing to work on one of these projects for now!
