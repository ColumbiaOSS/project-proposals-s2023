## Project Proposal
- Link [link]https://github.com/ulasonat/project-proposals-s2023/tree/main/projects/javascript
- My goal is to create an extension on Google Chrome for Prime Video that will translate a word from one language to another when clicked on it. There's an extension that does this for Netflix, but Prime Video users could also benefit from that.
