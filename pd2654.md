## Project Proposal
I'm not sure about what proposal to make yet. I have 4 ideas in my mind currently

1. Function previewer in editors. Sometimes the code editor provides the function parameters, but do not provide examples/what to put in each parameters.
2. Mounting Google Drive to Colab + selecting initial folders. Normally you have to put the code in the beginning of the code.
3. Auto-save model in Google Colab. There are times where google colab disconnect and the model I trained before is gone. Would be nice if there's a way
to auto-save models.
4. Cleaning my own project of 7 Wonders board game. I wrote a 7 Wonders Board Game entirely in Python for testing the reinforcement learning algorithm
in OpenAI Gym. However, I would like to extend my code so that other people can also test their own model.
