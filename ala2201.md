## Project Proposal
I would like to do something that revolves around sports. 
A lot of ideas have to do with analyzing, such as analyzing a users betting results data or analyzing a users fantasy football league data.
Those would be without scraping, another project idea could be web scraping (and then analyzing?) sports stats from college websites, NCAA websites for posrts are all the same format.
Another idea would be a game of some sort.

## Project Contributions
Sports repos I have looked up don't have significant contributors so for contributions I think I want to add to a well known repo such as numpy, pandas or matplotlib.
A repo called face recognition seems large and interesting, but the issues are not labeled.
