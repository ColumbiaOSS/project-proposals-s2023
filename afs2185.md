## Project Proposal
I'd like to work on one of the following possible projects:
- Network Library in C++
    - Considering how there is no networking code available in the standard library, I want to create a simple library that can handle basic network functionalities and protocols (e.g. DNS, HTTP 1.0, etc).
- Multithreading Library in C++
    - I want to create a general purpose library that provides a userful multithreading interface such as thread pools and job queues.
    `

## Project Contributions
My idea is to take a look at these famous/popular open source projects and tackling couple of smaller issues that are open:
- [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity)
- [qTox](https://github.com/qTox/qTox)
- [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)
