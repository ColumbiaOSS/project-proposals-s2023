## Project Proposal
I am thinking of making a consistent hashing with bounded loads library in C++ or Python (possibly a Python/C extension). 

## Project Contributions
I plan on contributing to AudioMoth, which is an [open-source acoustic logger](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices) written in C/C++. 
I previously contributed to this project (my changes have not been published yet) last spring 2022 when I was studying abroad at the University of Oxford, working with Professor Alex Rogers who is one of the people running the project.
