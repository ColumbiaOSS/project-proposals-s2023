## Project Proposal

1. enokiinc/aither

2. Easily configurable unix environments

## Project Contributions

1. Open source project from company I am interning at. They are planning to develop their open source project to show a presence to the community. I will be making contributions to the project and overviewing community feedback

2. Create project from scratch and find a way to make unix environments configurable from some kind of front-end or at least an easier way than digging into dot files.
