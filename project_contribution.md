## Matplotlib

The opensource library I want to contribute to is Matplotlib, which is a data visualization library for Python that provides a variety of plotting and 
charting capabilities. It allows for customization of plots, including color, labels, and shapes, and can display data in 2D and 3D format.

One Issue that I've identified that would be a good starting point for making contributions is [link](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/23817).
