## Project Proposal
- VS Code extension with keyboard shortcuts and visual aids to store and paste multiple text snippets
- VS Code comment extension which allows user to toggle comments on and off, see comments for lines with a keyboard shortcut + hover, auto adjust comments to a certain screen width, hovering functionality could be extended to long lists of arguments
- Google Docs extension that auto searches images based on text, offering a top selection of images with captions to use. Image offerings can be adjusted (e.g., cartoon, realistic), this would be a useful tool for primary educators who heavily rely on visual aids
- Chrome extension that can simplify any webpage (e.g., news articles) into the images on the page with a short summary, useful for visual people
- Chrome extension that automatically saves any inputted text or filled out form input. Sometimes I have navigated off websites or need to go back, but do not want to refill out forms
- Javascript input text library to make easy functions to ignore if text is empty or for formatting
- Additional python time library that only deals with by the hour or minute, to simplify things. Could include a library for dealing with ranges of time since I have previously found working with restaurant opening times difficult
- Javascript library that simplifies storing input values across page reloads
- Python error simplifier. Catch statements typically have similar code, maybe there is a way to simplify this
- Numpy data normalization library
- Python code statistics library, simplify measuring speed and space while providing default, easy to read strings
- Python to SQL library that simplifies queries
- VS Code extension that allows users to see code snippets when hovering over areas of the page summary
- Application for users to search for current exhibitions based off of artists. Most gallery searching websites/apps are organized by galleries, not artists. The only useful gallery app/tool is SeeSaw which is only available on Apple
