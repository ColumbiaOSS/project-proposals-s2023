## Project Proposal
I would like to continue working on Mar.io, a Discord bot which I initially wrote in Python after my freshman year at Columbia. While the bot currently has features like Wikipedia searches and YouTube streaming, it lacks thorough end-to-end testing due to my lack of experience at the time. I'd like to clean up any bugs (such as certain YouTube streams not having audio) and integrate better testing overall.
