## Project Proposal

 Pytorch-NLP-Cahatbot is a Python library designed to facilitate custom searches using the Google Search API. It features a user-friendly interface for querying, parsing, and analyzing search results. It also provides a mechanism to rank search results based on their relevance, calculated using TF-IDF scores.

Users can tailor their search queries, evaluate the relevance of search results, and refine their queries based on relevance feedback.

## Project Contributions

 I contribute to tf-idf FROM sklearn and do my own functionality built for user who
 want to build their own chatbot.
