## Contributions

[Contribution #1](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/pull/65988)

[Contribution #2 UNFINISHED](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/25093)

For contribution 2, this was the one of the few issues I found that was not old or extremely complex. I never used libraries like NumPy and such, so I chose SymPy because at least I could try to learn the math. I'm not sure if I'll be able to successfuly solve this issue by the deadline.
