## Project Proposal

I am thinking of making a consistent hashing with bounded loads library in C++ or Python (possibly a Python/C extension) based on the algorithm proposed in [this paper](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/consistent-hashing-with-bounded-loads.html) by Google Research. Alternatively, I am thinking of creating a Python/C extension for a new hybrid data structure that self-optimizes for the fastest access pattern based on a predefined size and a defined use case. The underlying data structure would vary between a sparse array, hash table (with different types of probing / chaining), splay tree, trie, etc.

## Project Contributions

I plan on contributing to AudioMoth, which is an [open-source acoustic logger](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices) written in C/C++.
I previously contributed to this project (my changes have not been published yet) last spring 2022 when I was studying abroad at the University of Oxford, working with Professor Alex Rogers who is one of the people running the project.
