## Project Proposal

A group itinerary app/website (in python, so probably Django). Coordinating a group to go on a trip together is difficult because some people may fly to
the same destination from different origins, some people may split off mid-trip to go somewhere else and rejoin, and some people might be staying in
different places (with relatives, for example). This python program will allow users to attach themselves to a specific trip. Each trip will have entities
inside of it (like flights, hotels, trains, AirBnBs, events, etc.) that each user can mark themselves as a part of. In the end, there is a comprehensive
itinerary where every person in the trip can see who is doing what at any given point in time.

It's like Splitwise but for trip planning, if you know what Splitwise is.
