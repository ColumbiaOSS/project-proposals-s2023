## Project Proposal

Financial reinforcement learning tasks often rely on backtest results. However, backtest results often cause some overfitting issues for reasons. A one-step-closer-to-real-world solution is doing [paper trading](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000516466-paper-trading-main-functionality/). My idea of project is to build a library to automate financial stock paper trading.
