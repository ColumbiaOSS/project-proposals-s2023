## Project Proposal

Financial reinforcement learning tasks often rely on backtest results. However, backtest results often cause some overfitting issues for reasons. One step closer to real-world situation is doing [paper trading](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000516466-paper-trading-main-functionality/). My idea of project is to build a library to automate financial stock paper trading.

## Project Contributions

Contribute to [FinRL](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL)
FinRL is a three-layer open-source framework for financial reinforcement learning. The three layers contain market environments, agents, and applications. For a trading task (the top layer), an agent (the middle layer) interacts with a market environment (the bottom layer), making sequential decisions.
