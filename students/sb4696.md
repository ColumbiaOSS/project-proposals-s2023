## Project Proposal

## IMPORTANT: PROJECT CHANGE

Unfortunately, after working on heap-detailed for a while, I realised that all the functionality I wanted to provide could easily be done by the user just by using the original heapq implementation, and digging a bit into the internal implementation and using internal functions. This would essentially render my library redundant.
