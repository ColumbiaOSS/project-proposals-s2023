## Project Proposal

An idea I have thought of is creating a Discord bot using Python to perform some sort of extra functionality in a server such
as conducting polls or interacting with a news api to surface headlines. I am not decided yet but am leaning towards the polling idea
since I find it more interesting and it likely is more feasible. Alternatively, a different idea I had was creating some sort of basic
image editing Python library to quickly make changes to photos.

## Project Contributions

Right now, I am thinking of contributing to either of numpy, pandas, or matplotlib libraries as I have used all three of these extensively
for other courses and across various projects and so there is a level of familiarity already. I am leaning towards going with matplotlib, as
there appear to be a good amount of new and good first issue bugs to resolve.
