## Project Proposal

An idea I have thought of is creating a Discord bot using Python to perform some sort of extra functionality in a server such
as conducting polls or interacting with a news api to surface headlines. I am not decided yet but am leaning towards the polling idea
since I find it more interesting and it likely is more feasible. Alternatively, a different idea I had was creating some sort of basic
image editing Python library to quickly make changes to photos.
