## Project Proposal

I was thinking of writing an SEC web scraper for certain financial documents from the EDGAR database such as the 10-K (and it's versions such as 10-K405,10-KSB), 20-F and 40-F. As of now, I will most likely focus on the 20-F since a lot of repositories could already exist for scraping the 10-K. The 10-K form is the annual reporting form for domestic (US) companies. On the other hand, the 20-F and 40-F are used by foreign entities (such as companies in Canada).

Additionally, I am thinking of creating an SEC document downloader that will query the EDGAR database, provided parameters like date-before and date-after, company ticker and form-type and retrieve company info and the requested files. At the very base level, it may act as a wrapper over these API page(s) : [EDGAR API page](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#) and [Accessing EDGAR data](https://www.sec.gov/os/accessing-edgar-data).

## Project Contributions

I'm thinking of making contributions to these repo's below:

- <https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq> (this is an open source quantum computing error correction library.)
- <https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary> (this is the official github repository for the internet archive, Archive.org. It is like an online licatalog of books available on the Internet)
- <https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq> (Another quantum computing library for error correction but this one is from Google. This is their official Cirq github repo)

 These repo's were the first that popped in my mind. Alternatively, I will also consider the more common libraries like numpy, matplotlib, scipy, etc.
