## Project Proposal

I would like to create a data visualization library that would specifically enable the user to easily visualize disease spread. I am not sure about the scope of this project yet, possibly I could even implement predictive modeling based on some data input by the user. .
I have spent a lot of time learning about and even teaching the science of epidemiology (the study of disease) and throughout both my experience as a student and teacher I have looked online for an easy way to visualize how disease spreads. However, all the options I found were either priced or not really helpful to my end goals. Therefore, I believe this project would be fulfilling a need and also would be in an area of (relative) personal expertise.

## Project Contributions

python pandas -- many good first issues to contribute to.
python plotly -- I am very familiar with this library and believe there are many ways I can contribute
python dash -- similar to plotly, I am familiar with the library and believe I can contribute a lot
