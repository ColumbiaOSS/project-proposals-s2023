Project: I have an idea for an algorithm that could split a geometrical shape into regions based on shortest paths between points, using visibility graphs and k-medoids grouping. It could be useful in geospacial analysis - for example, dividing a map into regions that organically follow geographical features that block access (lakes, mountains, canyons, etc.). For this, I could write a Python module that could be used along with popular polygon libraries (like Shapely and SymPy).
Another idea is to implement a lightweight fraction library that would help prevent some of the inaccuracies posed by floating point numbers (i.e. 1.2-1.0 = 0.199999999999999996). It could be used within algorithms involving numerous floating point calculations. Throughout the algorithm the numbers would be represented as fractions, and only converted to decimal floats for output.

Contribution: I've had to deal with Shapely quite a lot and I am familiar with certain unintuitive aspects of the library which I could potentially rework to make more user-friendly. Alternatively I could work on some of the bugs in MatPlotLib as it seems to have a lot of beginner-friendly issues.
