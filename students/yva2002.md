## Project Proposals

1. ao3 data scraper - build a scraper for archiveofourown.org, which is an open source repository for fanworks of popular media. the site has over 5 million users and 10 million works, but there is only one data scraper which does not have full functionality and was last updated two years ago.
i'd specifically like for users to be able to track macro-trends across the site, request trending content across a given time period, etc.  
2. build a cli-based youtube macro-data scraper (like an api for socialblade)
3. syntax highlighting in jupyter notebooks in browser and/or colab notebook
4. app to view and update terminal and bashrc configurations through gui

## Project Contributions

1. [observable plot](https://github.com/observablehq/plot) - easy dataviz plotting api
2. [airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow) - author, schedule, and monitor
3. [baserow](https://gitlab.com/bramw/baserow) would like to add support for email api integrations like mailerlite
4. [charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow) - tools for markdown on the cli
