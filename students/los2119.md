## Project Proposal

For my project, I'm looking into a couple of ideas:

- to build a browser extension to show how much time users are spending on specific sites
- Another idea is to build a browser extension to keep track of shopping wishlists from shopping sites they've visited
- Build an app to convert all sorts of units/currencies
- Build an app to track food/grocery expiry dates and trial expiry dates
- Build an app that would turn a user's phone silent based on their location and preference

## Project Contributions

I'm planning on starting my open source contribution journey as an actual beginner taking baby steps so in terms of projects to contribute to, I would be checking out [GitHub's good first issue topics page](https://github.com/topics/good-first-issue) and the [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) tool for good first issues to contribute to.
As I progress through my journey of open source, I would also like to make contributions to tools and libraries I use on a daily listed below:

- Flask
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- React and React-native
