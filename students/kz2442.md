## Project Proposal

I customized a virtual avatar recently, so I am interested in design tools for VTuber broadcast.

VTube Studio is the most popular App for Vtubers. So I want to design a Python library for use by other plugin authors which implements the VTube Studio API.

## Project Contributions

I want to contribute to the project [DenchiSoft/VTuberStudio](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio).

### My First Contribution

Recently, I used a open source project lewansoul-lx16a. It can help us control LX16A servo with library or a GUI tool.

I found an issue [#4](https://github.com/maximkulkin/lewansoul-lx16a/issues/4) about the installtion of PyQt5 on MacOS. I make a Pull Request to fix it, and here is the link of my first contribution

* [PR#11](https://github.com/maximkulkin/lewansoul-lx16a/pull/11).
