## Project Proposal

I customized a virtual avatar recently, so I am interested in design tools for VTuber broadcase.

VTube Studio is the most popular App for Vtubers. So I want to design a Python library for use by other plugin authors which implements the VTube Studio API.

## Project Contributions

I want to contribute to the project [DenchiSoft/VTuberStudio](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio).
