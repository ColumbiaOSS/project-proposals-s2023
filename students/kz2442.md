## Project Proposal

I customized a virtual avatar recently, so I am interested in design tools for VTuber broadcast.

VTube Studio is the most popular App for Vtubers. So I want to design a Python library for use by other plugin authors which implements the VTube Studio API.

* [pyvts GitHub page](https://github.com/Genteki/pyvts)

## Project Contributions

I want to contribute to the project [DenchiSoft/VTuberStudio](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio).

### Contributions

### lewansoul-lx16a

Recently, I used a open source project lewansoul-lx16a. It can help us control LX16A servo with library or a GUI tool.

* [lewansoul-lx16a](https://github.com/maximkulkin/lewansoul-lx16a)
  
I found an issue [#4](https://github.com/maximkulkin/lewansoul-lx16a/issues/4) about the installtion of PyQt5 on MacOS. I make a Pull Request to fix it, and here is the link of my first contribution

* [PR#11](https://github.com/maximkulkin/lewansoul-lx16a/pull/11).

### VtubeStudio

I update my library `pyvts` to [VtubeStudio Development page](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio)

* [PR#17](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/pull/57)

### GPTVtuber-2.0

Someone used my library `pyvts` and developed a [GPTVtuber](https://github.com/rakky33/GPTVtuber-2.0). I did some work on it.

* [PR#6](https://github.com/rakky33/GPTVtuber-2.0/pull/6)

In this pull request, I

* Write a class GUI in app/gui.py
* Update `.gitignore` to let git automatucally ignore `AUTH_KEY.py`
* Write test file `run_app.py` to test GUI
