## Project Proposal

Website / App to connect with a Music Application (Spotify probably) to allow others to queue songs into your device.
Ideally, the phone or device would scan a QR code to get to a webpage that's simply and a searchbar to add songs and a list to see what is already queued.

## Project Contributions

Next.js is a framework I've used in every internship I've been apart of, I'd like to give back to them in some way.
