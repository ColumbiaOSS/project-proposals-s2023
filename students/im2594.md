## Project Proposal

Create a library which acts as a MongoDB wrapper in JavaScript to perform common database operations. Using this library, complex queries do not need to be added within the application itself and the application can simply provide this library all of the database information needed (host, port, collection name, etc). The library can then intialize the database and provide interfaces to interact with its collections.

## Project Contribution

I would like to contribute to open source projects or programming languages such as Protocol Buffer/gRPC and Golang/C++. I will look into the open issue section of these open source project and will attempt to pick an open issue and contribute into it.
