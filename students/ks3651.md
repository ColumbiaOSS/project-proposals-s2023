## Project Proposal

I brainstormed some ideas and want to choose one of them, but I'm not sure if I've picked the right project. I'd like to discuss this problem with the professor after the next class or during office hours.

JavaScript

- Creating a To-do List

1. Appropriate Level of Difficulty: I think creating a to-do list is an appropriate project in terms of its level of difficulty. I am not a fast learner, but I believe I can complete this project in a semester.
2. Extensibility: The to-do list project has the potential to be extended with various functionalities. For example, the core functionality is to add and delete tasks. But, it can be further expanded to include an alarm function that alerts the user when the deadline is approaching. Additionally, a filter function can be added to allow users to find specific information easily.

Python

- Exchange Rate Converter

The project will involve finding the necessary libraries and writing a code that can crawl exchange rate information using different output codes.

Python (Automation)

- Web Page Automation Using Auto Mouse

The goal of this project is to create a program that can automatically retrieve weather information from a web page. The code will manipulate the mouse and keyboard to extract the weather information in real-time when the user requests it.

- Sending Google Emails

The project involves writing a code that can automatically send a large number of emails by sending an email to a Python code through Google Mail. The email addresses will be read from an Excel file.

- Sending Notifications to Your Smartphone for Specific Keywords in Emails

The project involves creating a program that reads gmail and sends notifications to your smartphone using slack when a specific keyword appears. This idea came from the challenge of having to sort through many emails every day to find the important ones. Gmail already has a labeling function that classifies emails based on specific email addresses as filters. This project aims to create a function that sends notifications based on keywords using slack and smartphones. There is also potential to expand this project to find information in other ways besides just keywords.

Python (Crawling)

- Collecting Real-time Search Terms

The project involves creating a program that can gather real-time search terms to identify trending topics. There is a high possibility of expanding this project by incorporating smartphones or converting it into a GUI program.

Python (AI)

- Creating a Speech Recognition Secretary

Inspired by the popularity of chatGPT, this project involves creating a voice recognition assistant that converts voice into text through voice recognition and performs actions based on the conditions of the text.

- Recognizing and Classifying People in Pictures

This project uses the torch library to classify only person pictures among various types of pictures and move them to a specific folder.

Since I do not have an extensive background in github/open source projects, I might need to change the topic I would like to work on for this semester - but I am willing to work on one of these projects for now!

## Project Contributions

[First Contribution](https://github.com/danthareja/contribute-to-open-source/issues/1)

The project has a scenario where I am at a calculator company and there are some unnecessary parts in our code that need to be fixed

I believe this project is ideal for my first contribution. Although I am unfamiliar with both Git and GitHub, as well as the concept of "contribution," the project does not seem overly burdensome, so I can feel a sense of accomplishment. Additionally, I think it will allow me to gain a better understanding of the project as a whole.

When I looked at other projects labeled "For Beginners," I found the most challenging aspect to be the abundance of files in the folder. I often felt overwhelmed and unsure of where to start with the README.md file.

Therefore, for this project, I will make it a priority to thoroughly read the README file and understand the flow of how to contribute to the project.

1. Jupyter notebook
2. Jarvis
3. Pandas
4. Sympy

- The way I would like to contribute

1. Fixing errors
2. Adding clarifications/documentations for beginners
3. Adding some new features
