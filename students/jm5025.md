## Project Proposal

`MC_Toolbox` is a library for Explicit-State Model Checking (will also support Symbolic Model Checking and Bounded Model Checking in the future) on general Kripke Structures supporting the CTL(Computation Tree Logic) operators: EX, EU, and EG.

Users can create checker instances to formally verify if a Kripke Structure (can be created during runtime or input in a JSON file) satisfies certain CTL properties. The checker instance will return "SAT" if satisfied and an Error Trace if unsatisfed.

## Project Contributions

PyScript is a meta project that aims to combine multiple open technologies into a framework that allows users to create sophisticated browser applications with Python. It integrates seamlessly with the way the DOM works in the browser and allows users to add Python logic in a way that feels natural both to web and Python developers.
