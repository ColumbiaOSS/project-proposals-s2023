## Project Proposal

## IMPORTANT: PROJECT CHANGE

Unfortunately, streeteasy.com didn't like me webscraping it and i've been perma-banned from it!
I'll keep the project repo open since that's where I submitted my homework for assignments 3-5.

However starting from HW6, i'd like for a new repo to be graded, which is called bulk-mv and it is an interactive command line utility to
add, delete, rename, and move multiple files/directories. Here are some links for it:

### This is the old project

A webscraper for streeteasy.com, on top of which I will add a simple to use
api for developers to use in their apps.
