## Project Proposal

-Chrome extension - maybe a size chart converter where you enter your sizes and then it checks for you rather than having to manually look at an individual website's size chart, opening reddit links with old.reddit instead

## Project Contributions

-Discord bot (python)
-something related to using Spotify
