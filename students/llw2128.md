## Project Proposal

- [CBSummary](../projects/python/CBSummary.md)
- I want to do something that makes it easier to learn more about startups. I want to make a library that scrapes and compiles company data from new filings, IPOs, and reports.

## Project Contributions

- [1st contribution statsmodels](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/pull/8760) (note that the build seems to fail on linux for all latest PR of this version due to dependencies, unrelated to documentaiton update)
- [matplotlib](../projects/python/matplotlib.md)
- I will contibute to the matplotlib library in python.
