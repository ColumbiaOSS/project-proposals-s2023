# Project Proposal
[project link](https://github.com/Kawamiya/customizable-login-component-library)

A small library for login/register based on vue3, using material design style and supporting custom theme. 
* The idea is based on [bm-vue-login](https://github.com/BIGDgreen/bm-vue-login), but this project is implemented based on vue2 and does not support custom styles.
