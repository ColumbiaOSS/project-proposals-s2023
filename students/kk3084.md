## Project Proposal

One possible idea I have for the project is to create library of predefined image augmentation presets. This means that given some training images the library artificially creates more training images through different ways of processing such as random rotation, shifts, shear, and flips, etc. A simple interface for image augmentations would be ideal.

## Project Contributions

There are some good first issues for hugginface's transfomer library which I want to contribute to. I have used huggingface once or twice before and would like to see if I can contribute. Other libraries which I have used extensively are Tenserflow and Pytorch. Another option is to contribute to these libraries which also have some good first issues.
