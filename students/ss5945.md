## Project Proposal

I would like to continue working on a library that scans PDFs of LinkedIn profiles. This was originally part of my lo-fi prototype for my final project in COMS 4170: UI Design last fall, but the original version was very rudimentary and didn't do much besides extracting the PDF data into a sanitized list of strings. I'd like to work on organizing the scraped data in a better way, perhaps by using a dictionary or a JSON object.
