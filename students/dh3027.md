## Project Proposal

There are various complex data structures that are commond in leetcode or codeforce, such as tree and dp table ect. When we try to debug and inspect these data structures using debugger in IDEs, contents in those structures can't be intuitively displayed. Therefore I want to write a python package that can beautifully print out these structures and help users to inspect their contents.

## Project Contributions

[python-google-nest-sdm](https://github.com/allenporter/python-google-nest-sdm) is a python library that can communicate with Google Nest API. This pakage allows users to control Nest devices using python. I want to make some improvement to this project.

Also I use Numpy all the time and there are many open issues, I also want to make some contrubution to it.
