## Project Proposal

I'm planning to build a library in Java (or maybe Javascript) to automate the process of web pentesting.

About the project:

WildFly Elytron is a new WildFly sub-project which is completely replacing the combination of PicketBox and JAAS as the WildFly client and server security mechanism.

An "elytron" (ĕl´·ĭ·trŏn, plural "elytra") is the hard, protective casing over a wing of certain flying insects (e.g. beetles).
