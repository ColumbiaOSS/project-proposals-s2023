## Project Proposal

I am interested in building an API for python that provides quick access for collectable sports card data. Simmilar tools exsist
for pokemon of mtg cards that both maintain a digital collection and provide an estimate of value. This has been a personal frustration and something confirmed in forms. I am unsure how wide to scope this project but I could imagine a range of milestones that could make the project somewhat flexible.

Milestones:

1. Levrage webscraping to create basic database of cards via the topps website and ebay for potential images (will look for better source?)

2. Build tooling for querying and updating entries

3. Create api tooling allowing for tracking of PC (personal collection) for each user

4. Establish a pipeline for pricing using external sources that should already exsist

A more well worked example could be something like this Pokemon tool [link](https://pokemontcg.io/)

## Project Contributions

I am really interested in contributing to a large python library like Pandas, Numpy, or Pytorch.
