## Project Proposal

I am interested in building an API that provides access for sports card data.
Simmilar tools exsist for pokemon of mtg cards that both maintain a digital collection and provide an estimate of value.

Milestones:

1. Levrage webscraping to create basic database of cards via the topps website and ebay for potential images
2. Build tooling for querying and updating entries

3. Create api tooling allowing for tracking of PC (personal collection) for each user

4. Establish a pipeline for pricing using external sources that should already exsist

A more well worked example could be something like this Pokemon tool [link](https://pokemontcg.io/)
