## Project Proposal

Valgrind has a feature that lets it output XML files describing any memory leaks
or errors encountered. I plan to work on a Python library that parses these XML files
and can be used to write scripts for CI systems, to generate supression files, and
handle fatal signals in executables in a consistent way without having to rely on
brittle regexes or other parsing code for standard Valgrind output.

## Project Contributions

I've found a few bugs in Valgrind, GNU coreutils, and pandas. I'd like to attempt
to fix some of them.
