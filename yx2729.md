## Project Proposal
I would like to develop an opinion monitoring system that supports 
- Visualization of hot opinion over a period of time
- Multi-platform opinion display
- Search for opinion sentiment of keyword entities
- Emotional Analysis
- Focused Discussion Platforms
- (maybe) abbreviation/alias/typo analysis

## Project Contributions
Hope to cover hundreds of different websites and playforms. The discussion platform suggestion function and abbreviation/alias/typo analysis are new contributions different from previous ones.
