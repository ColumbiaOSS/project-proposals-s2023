## Project Proposal
idea1
I would like to build a shell "recording" tool Shecord that can:
- when execute the tool for the first time, the shell recording is on and all Commands and output generated afterwards are recorded
  - user should be able to choose the output file content coverage (for example, in/out/error...)
  - user should be able to set the output file type and path
  - user should be able to select a layout for the output file (for example, markdown as lecture note, for future use as shell scripts)
- when execute the tool for the second time, the shell recording is off and a file containing all logs in the recording period is saved



idea2
I would like to build a conprehensive translation tool tandem with different commercial software for translation, paraphrase and grammar checking.
- when input the original language, the tool should be able to automatically complete translation, paraphrase, and grammar cheching
  - user should be able to choose their preferred third party software
  - user should be able to make basic settings
  - different translation rewrites will be presented to the user for selection
