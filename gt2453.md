## Project Proposal [link](https://github.com/gil2rok/project-proposals-s2023/blob/main/build-repo.md)

Make a library to support my research on reconstructing evolutionary trees from genetic sequencing data. Support rigourous testing and documentation.

## Project Contributions [link](https://github.com/gil2rok/project-proposals-s2023/blob/main/contribute-repo.md)

Allowing [Conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) to better export environments by minituarizing the requirements to the minimum necessary packages. From this smaller list of packages, Conda itself will infer the remaining requirements.
