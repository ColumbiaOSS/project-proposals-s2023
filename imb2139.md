## Project Proposal

I'm still not totally sure what direction I want to go in for the project, so
here are a few of my initial ideas.

### LaTeX generator

I use LaTeX a lot, and I've noticed that it can be very repetitive and tedious
to code certain things by hand. I'd like to explore automatically generating
LaTeX code using a very simple Python interface. I'd like to also provide an
interface for generating diagrams and tables given formal specifications (e.g.,
a TikZ finite state machine given a set of states, transitions, etc.; a matrix
for a normal-form game given the set of players, each player's strategy, etc.).

### Clang AST fun

I've worked a bit with the Clang Python bindings (via `libclang`) to query the
AST of C programs. There are a lot of cool things you can do with `libclang`,
like large-scale refactoring of code, and smart, context-driven static
analysis, but the Python interface can be annoying to work with, especially if
you aren't familiar with the Clang AST. I'd like to create a tool to facilitate
specific use cases of `libclang` (especially for testing and grading), like the
following:

- Find (and replace) calls to certain functions
- Find (and replace) function definitions
- Generate memory diagrams
