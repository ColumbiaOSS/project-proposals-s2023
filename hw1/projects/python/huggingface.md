Huggingface provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models which can reduce compute costs, carbon footprint, and save the time and resources required to train a model from scratch. I plan to start out by improving simple features and then hopefully expand into more complicated issues.

## Issues

- [FEATURE: Add support for BLIP and GIT in image-to-text and VQA pipelines](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/21110)
- [FEATURE: Is there a no_trainer version for image pertaining](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/20053)
