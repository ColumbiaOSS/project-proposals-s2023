# Content Analyzer - Google Chrome Extension

Extensions are software programs, built on web technologies (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that enable users to customize the Chrome browsing experience. I want to create a `Google Chrome extension` that notifies someone maybe once or twice throughout the day with questions about their life and sends it back to them weeks or months later.

## Possible Features

- Ask varied prompts throughout the day
- sends back their responses later
- More features to come
