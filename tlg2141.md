## Project Proposal
I am interested in building an API for python that provides quick access for collectable sports card data. Simmilar tools exsist 
for pokemon of mtg cards that both maintain a digital collection and provide an estimate of value. This has been a personal frustration 
and something confirmed in forms. I am unsure how wide to scope this project but I could imagine a range of milestones that could make the project somewhat flexible. The initial things I would want to do is capture recent card sets for a specific domain and make them easily queryable (for example being able to find all cards for a certain player in a certain year). Next would be a way for each user to maintain there own collection. Last would be the pricing tool which could be based off of websites that track price more effectively than is possible given the short run of the project. I have experience in Python and Webdev with JS so I think this could be a good fit
as the initial thing I would like to create would be a python library that linked to data.

A more well worked example could be something like this Pokemon tool [link](https://pokemontcg.io/)

I will also note that I am currently working on a partial CV system to scan cards and index them which is why this system could be really effective for me.


## Project Contributions
I am really interested in contributing to a library like Pandas, Numpy, or Pytorch as they have been very important to my undergraduate career.
