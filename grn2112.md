## Project Proposal
An idea I have thought of is creating a Discord bot using Python to perform some sort of extra functionality in a server such 
as conducting polls or interacting with a news api to surface headlines. I am not decided yet but am leaning towards the polling idea
since I find it more interesting and it likely is more feasible. Alternatively, a different idea I had was creating some sort of basic 
image editing Python library to quickly make changes to photos.

## Project Contributions
I plan to contribute to Matplotlib, as there appear to be a good amount of new and good first issue bugs to resolve.
