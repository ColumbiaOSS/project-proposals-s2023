## Project Proposal
I would like to make a discord bot for my open source project. It will be coded using python. I am not entirely sure what the bot will do, but some options are: music bot, minigames bot (trivia, guess the number, etc.), roles bot, points bot (number of messages, etc.), or a combination of the above!

## Project Contributions
I am not 100% sure what project I would like to contribue to, but I am currently leanign towards Pandas (the python library).
