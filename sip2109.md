## Project Proposal

A scraper that takes a given word or set of words of another language and checks [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) for it. It then gives the translation and grammar. I made a very simple script of this a long time ago when studying Latin and found it incredibly useful, but it would be cool to make a properly fleshed out version. Though I would aim for any Wiktionary supported language, I would start with making it work for at least Latin. Project would probably be in Python.

## Project Contributions

I've been working on [betteR20](https://github.com/TheGiddyLimit/betterR20) for roughly 2 years now, and would like to continue.
