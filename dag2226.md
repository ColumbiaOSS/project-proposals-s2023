## Project Proposal
My project idea is to create a library which helps users do some basic web scraping operations. Oftentimes when doing webscraping I rewrite code with slightly changed parameters to fit the website I scrape from. This library would be a tool that can scrape essentials from websites (tables, links, headers, etc.). I also plan on having the functionality to generate and traverse hyperlink trees.

## Project Contributions
I'd like to contribute to the NumPy package because it's used all the time and has tons of open issues, so there's bound to be something I can help out with.
