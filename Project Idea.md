<h1 align="center"> Chrome extension for NBA scores and specific player data </h1>

</br>

<p> This chrome extension acts as a personalized sports hub and allows users to view live NBA (and eventually NFL) scores for the teams they want and particular players' individual stats based on user preferences. I always found it annoying to constantly search up stats for a game I was monitoring while studying and I was too lazy to install official apps too. This alleviates the inconvenience of always having to manually search up stats or open one's phone while working. The data would simply be displayed in corner of the browser when desired.  </p>
