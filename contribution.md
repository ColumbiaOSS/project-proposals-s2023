This open source project aims at creating any sandboxed linux environment thats is multiplayer and browser accessible. 

They are currently having issues with using different base images using different linux distributions. They currently only offer an Alpine based image so I can start by creating a new ubuntu based image since it incorporates more features such as native vscode for instance.
