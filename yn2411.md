## Project Proposal
Honestly still TBD, but maybe chrome extension that lets two anonymous users that are simlutaneously browsing the same page talk to each other anonymously

## Project Contributions
It's not a Python or Javascript library, but I would like to contribute to this project https://github.com/Unirep if that's allowed.
