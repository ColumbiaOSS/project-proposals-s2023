## Project Proposal
dinosaur taxonomy library
    https://github.com/junosuarez/dinosaurs is a list of dino names, but there’s no data on them
    ‘dino’ classes, ‘clade’ classes, properties of dinos or clades, methods to compare when they lived, methods to compare their phylogenetic distance, method to pick a random dino, method to pick a random dino based on its clade
job search tool
    create classes including job titles, company name, company size, summary, link, etc
    prob exists already
    why would python/js be better than excel?
random generator
    generates random numbers, names (of different types; see fantasynamegenerators.com), objects, words starting with a particular letter, etc
character sorter
    enter characters + relationships? this would be a database not a library
class finder
    check if there’s a waitlist, look up class info, time conflicts, what reqs are satisfied
    either overly abstract (just a framework) or overly granular (just Columbia)

this one looks interesting and doable, but it was last edited like 3yrs ago and something’s wrong with the site—it was taken over by some random person’s portfolio, it looks like? https://github.com/nitronova/StudyGameDev.com 
also hasn’t been updated in a while, also has something wrong with the site https://github.com/indentlabs/fiction-tools 
this site looks good, lots of issues open but also lots of pull requests apparently unattended to https://github.com/indentlabs/notebook
