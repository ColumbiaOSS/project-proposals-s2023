## Project Proposal

- copy text without extraneous new lines; optionally with quotes around it; optionally with MORE newlines?; ...I probably can't copy a quote and get the url at the same time, can I? that'd be SUPER cool; copy table from PDF to google doc with correct formatting (“paste table”)

- google docs extension (https://developers.google.com/apps-script) for (1) setting my keybindings automatically, e.g. my accent keybindings (2) using vim keybindings [looks like it exists] (3) using LaTeX [also looks like it exists] (4) resizing images that you copy-paste from your phone??
    - maybe implemenet some of the open-source writing tools into google docs?

- expansion of Superstore fake data creator, but more customizable + with more 'situations' of fake data. could also be extended in a fiction-writing or RPG-playing direction: "create the staff of a building" and it just makes a bunch of characters and characteristics.

- if I were better at math / got help, I could implement the SEJI transform (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362791216_Solving_ordinary_differential_equations_using_a_new_general_complex_integral_transform)  for “Solving Population Growth and Decay Problems Using Complex SEE Transform” (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358047757_Solving_Population_Growth_and_Decay_Problems_Using_Complex_SEE_Transform)

- scrape wiktionary to make a dictionary that translates into multiple languages at once https://github.com/open-source-ideas/ideas/issues/180 

- dinosaur taxonomy library
    - https://github.com/junosuarez/dinosaurs is a list of dino names, but there’s no data on them
    - ‘dino’ classes, ‘clade’ classes, properties of dinos or clades, methods to compare when they lived, methods to compare their phylogenetic distance, method to pick a random dino, method to pick a random dino based on its clade
    - this is more of a database tbh

Old ideas that I'm keeping just for the heck of it:
- “what country was in a location at a given year”
- drawing prompt generator
- get citation from URL using scraper
- job search tool
    - create objects including job titles, company name, company size, summary, link, etc
    - prob exists already
    - why would python/js be better than excel?
- random generator
    - generates random numbers, names (of different types; see fantasynamegenerators.com), objects, words starting with a particular letter, etc
- character sorter
    - enter characters + relationships? this would be a database not a library
- class finder
    - check if there’s a waitlist, look up class info, time conflicts, what reqs are satisfied.
    - either overly abstract (just a framework) or overly granular (just Columbia)



## Project Contributions

- *Krita (https://invent.kde.org/graphics/krita) 
    - this is the one I would most want to contribute to, but idk how feasible that would be, given that I know little to nothing about graphics, C++, or Qt. It looks like there are python scripting capabilities.

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- “dash” apparently?
- scipy
- seaborn
- re (https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.11/Lib/re/)
- vader
- SQLAlchemy
- NLTK (an NLP library)
- pypi “requests” library (https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.11/Lib/re/) 
- BeautifulSoup
- IPython / Jupyter ??
    - Jupyter notebook (https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

- maybe one of the open source writing tools?: https://github.com/open-source-writing-tools 
- Open DnD: https://github.com/opendnd 
- this one looks interesting and doable, but it was last edited like 3yrs ago and something’s wrong with the site—it was taken over by some random person’s portfolio, it looks like? https://github.com/nitronova/StudyGameDev.com 
- also hasn’t been updated in a while, also has something wrong with the site https://github.com/indentlabs/fiction-tools 
- this site looks good, lots of issues open but also lots of pull requests apparently unattended to https://github.com/indentlabs/notebook
