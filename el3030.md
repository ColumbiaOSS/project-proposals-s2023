## Project Proposal
My project will be a core logic library in python for an eventual group itinerary app/website. Coordinating a group to go on a trip together is difficult because some people may fly to the same destination from different origins, some people may split off mid-trip to go somewhere else and rejoin, and some people might be staying in different places (with relatives, for example). This python program will allow users to attach themselves to a specific trip. Each trip will have entities inside of it (like flights, hotels, trains, AirBnBs, events, etc.) that each user can mark themselves as a part of. In the end, there is a comprehensive itinerary where every person in the trip can see who is doing what at any given point in time. 

It's like Splitwise but for trip planning instead of money.
