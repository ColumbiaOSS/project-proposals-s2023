## Project Proposal
I have a few project ideas in mind, I would like to work on one of them, depending on which one is more aligned with the goals of the class. 

1) Invlolved heap package: Python has a heapq library, which hides all the details of a heap data structure from the programmer. I am interested in writing a 
library that allows the user more control and teaches them the concepts of a heap in more detail than heapq

2)Class scheduler and timetable maker: Given a bunch of classes and TA positions a student has, this package can output all possible combinations of
non intersecting commitments and output a nicely formatted calender or possible a google calender integratable file.

3) A shortest path finder. I want to create a library that will tell you the shortest path from one place to another, using dijkstra's algorithm.


## Project Contributions
I would like to contribute to larger projects such as NumPy, NLTK and Tensorflow.
