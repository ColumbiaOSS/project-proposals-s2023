## Project Proposal
I customized a virtual avatar recently, so I want to design a VTuber tool for my future live boardcast.

I plan to work on a VTuber Tool, which can project my head motion on the virtual avatar through face tracking.

## Project Contributions
There is a project of VTuber tool [VTuber_Unity](https://github.com/kwea123/VTuber_Unity), but archived for years.

I want to contribute to my new project based on the idea of [VTuber_Unity](https://github.com/kwea123/VTuber_Unity).
