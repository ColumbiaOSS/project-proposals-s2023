## Project Proposal
For my project, I would like to implement a model from a Computer Vision paper. There are a number of papers I'm interested in:

[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14024v1)
[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02108)
[link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Shugrina_Creative_Flow_Dataset_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf)

My project area will likely be in style transfer in computer vision, natural language transduction, or image animation. I am still deciding which implementation will be most feasible which is why I unfortunately cannot be more specific. 


## Project Contributions
There are many tagged good first issues in the pytorch and numpy library. I'll pick one of those.
