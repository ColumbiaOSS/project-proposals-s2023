## Project Proposal
Maintaing a history of commands executed for a folder from any terminal. 

Motivation: It often happens that I forget how I setup a project or forget a command that I used as a solution to an error. And, once we close the terminal the history of commands is lost. 

Solution: Build a tool that maintains the history of all the commands executed and the timestamp in a file . The tool can be customised to take in preferences like storing only new commands or deleting older that 10 days of commands. The tool can also provide efficient searching and segregration of the commands, for example segregating all the software installs. 


## Project Contributions
I am planning to contribute to Pandas, since I have previously contributed to used the library for projects and have also contributed to it once.
