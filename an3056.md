## Project Proposal

- Create a component library that offers users prebuilt React components to build sleek, innovative UI's with inspiration from innovators in the space like [Linear](https://linear.app/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

- Build a type safe, all in one utility library for Typescript that makes working with primitive data types very easy similar to what exists in the Java ecosystem with the [Apache Common Utils](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/).
